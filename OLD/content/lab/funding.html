<p>This is a list of successful grant applications from our lab (over $2.2 million since the lab started 6 years ago). The list of unsuccessful ones is rather longer.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I am also starting to post some past grant proposals, inspired by the example of <a href="http://ged.msu.edu/research.html#grants">C. Titus Brown</a>. I am not posting all, since many involve intellectual contributions by others, but this should give you examples that could be helpful in writing your own grants. Differential access to examples may be one of the subtle biases in science (are you at a big university with lots of grants to look at, or are you the only one in your area at a smaller institution) so whatever we can do to make this more accessible could help broaden the pool of scientists. I will report on outcomes but not include reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://brianomeara.info/sites/default/files/OMearaNSFCAREER_2014_Pruned.pdf">CAREER proposal 2014</a>: I have pruned off my department head’s letter and my personal information, but I have left on everything else, not just the project description, so you can have a sense of how NSF budgets work.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://brianomeara.info/sites/default/files/OMearaAVAToL_PreliminaryProposal2011.pdf">AVAToL ideas lab 2011</a>: The NSF issued a call for an <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2011/nsf11534/nsf11534.htm">Ideas Lab activity to stimulate transformative approaches to building, visualizing, and analyzing an interactive tree of life</a>. Selection for participation in this Ideas Lab was required for later involvement in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=124386">grants arising from it</a>, but I was not selected for it, so this may not be a positive example to use. Note that for Ideas Lab proposals, NSF may use an occupational psychologist to advise about applicants’ potential to work in teams, develop new research ideas, and so forth (and did in this case), so proposals may need tuning to appeal to this kind of reviewer, as well.</p></li>
