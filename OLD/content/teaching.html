<p>I teach a variety of classes: usually a portion of the Graduate Core course (phylogenetics), a mandatory course for all graduate students; a 400-level (upper level undergrads and beginning grad students) course on macroevolution; introductory biology (Biodiversity: Bio150); and a variety of smaller graduate seminars. My current teaching load is Macroevolution every fall, Core every fall, Biodiversity every other spring, and usually a graduate seminar per semester. In 2015-16, Iâ€™ll be stepping back from teaching Core to start a new, intensive graduate class on phylogenetic methods.</p>
