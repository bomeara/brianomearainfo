      <description>I went up for tenure in 2014-5 and was awarded it in 2015; at the suggestion of colleagues in the department I am now going up for promotion to full in 2018-9. This page will have information on my materials as they develop. For those writing letters, please check here for the latest info as publications appear, etc. My updated CV is here but perhaps more useful is a CV highlighting products only created since my tenure packet went in (the work that is the main focus on the promotion decision is in black text, the earlier work (summer 2014 and earlier) is in gray) which is here.</description>

      <description>The Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant was a beloved NSF program that gave small amounts of money (up to $19K) for projects to enhance the dissertations of PhD candidates. Its cancellation was motivated by programmatic needs at NSF. Each DDIG grant requires as much diligence and work by NSF as a regular grant of hundreds of thousands of dollars; in an environment where NSF had to cut its workload, cutting this program dramatically decreased the number of grants NSF had to handle without impacting overall funding to biology as much as other programs.</description>

      <description>Most of my website is designed for a specialized scientific audience, but it is important to include a summary for a general audience: taxpayers, colleagues outside of science, and so forth. Faculty members are responsible for teaching, research, and service; of the three, research may be the least understood (one common misconception is that professors only teach; we teach, but contributing new knowledge in addition to disseminating existing knowledge is also a major part of our jobs), so I start with that, though all are important.</description>

      <description>I was up for tenure in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the U. of Tennessee, Knoxville, over the 2014-2015 school year. This involves being evaluated at the department, college, and university level for a history of research, teaching, and service. If ultimately approved (it was in my case), it results in great job security (though not absolute, which is probably good); if rejected, it results in a year to find another position before being fired.</description>

      <guid>/teaching/</guid>
      <description>I teach a variety of classes: usually a portion of the Graduate Core course (phylogenetics), a mandatory course for all graduate students; a 400-level (upper level undergrads and beginning grad students) course on macroevolution; introductory biology (Biodiversity: Bio150); and a variety of smaller graduate seminars. My current teaching load is Macroevolution every fall, Core every fall, Biodiversity every other spring, and usually a graduate seminar per semester. In 2015-16, I’ll be stepping back from teaching Core to start a new, intensive graduate class on phylogenetic methods.</description>

      <description>Phylogenetic analysis
Each item includes PAUP batch files or commands where appropriate. I wrote this page for the Farrell Lab website, but have included it here as well, where I continue to update it (occasionally). This page is mostly useful for the batch files which are on it. Some useful references which provide broader overviews of phylogenetics are Phylogenetic Trees Made Easy by Barry Hall, chapters 11 and 12 of the somewhat dated (1996) Molecular Systematics, 2nd Edition, edited by David Hillis, Craig Moritz, and Barbara Mable, and the recently updated Molecular Systematics website.</description>

      <title>Model Selection Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)</title>

      <guid>/tutorials/aic/</guid>
      <description>This web page basically summarizes information from Burnham and Anderson (2002). Go there for more information. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a way of selecting a model from a set of models. The chosen model is the one that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between the model and the truth. It’s based on information theory, but a heuristic way to think about it is as a criterion that seeks a model that has a good fit to the truth but few parameters.</description>

      <description>This CV is from June 2018: to see recent publications, go to Google Scholar. You may also download a PDF from here. The CV is generated using information from Orcid, ImpactStory, GitHub, and Google Scholar. The code used to generate this is freely available here, though it has to be updated to deal with Orcid’s recent API changes.

      <title>Should you go to grad school to be a professor?</title>

      <guid>/shouldyougotogradschool/</guid>
      <description>A key question I get from advanced level undergrads is whether they should go to grad school intending to be a professor. I also tell prospective students in my lab some of the benefits and costs of choosing this career path. Here I am compiling some of this information; note that this is my personal view. Pros
 If all goes well, you get to pursue your passion: if you care about how anoles in Cuba feed, you can spend your life studying that; or figuring out how Ebola spreads, what conditions are required for life to evolve, etc.</description>

      <description>Students and postdocs in my lab will (eventually) find these very funny. This is how you know your education is complete. They are all from the web comic xkcd by Randall Munroe. There are two implementations of this drawing style in R: a general plotting one at http://xkcd.r-forge.r-project.org/ and one for phylogenies in phytools.

      <description>I develop a variety of open source software and scripts. I generally use perl for scripts and C/C++ for software, but I also code in R, PHP, javascript, and Matlab.
Major:
 Brownie: Software for analyzing rate of continuous character evolution and testing for different rates in different groups. A version in beta testing allows investigation of correlation of discrete and continuous traits, many more models for discrete and continuous trait evolution, species delimitation, and more.</description>

      <description>We are a Mac lab. Basic info when setting up a new one (modifying heavily from Bob Rudis’ example here):
 Turn on, create initial account, register with UTK.
 Create temporary account with admin privileges.
 Restart in this account, then use Migration Assistant to copy existing lab accounts and files from existing computer.
 Update all software (Mac App store)
 Install Xcode from the Mac App store.</description>

      <description>Our lab is located at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. The nearest airport is Knoxville McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) and we are at the intersection of I-40 and I-75. We’re about three hours by car from Atlanta and Nashville (the nearest airports with direct flights to many destinations). The nearest Amtrak station is about three hours away by car (Atlanta, GA), and we’re approx.</description>

      <description>This is a list of successful grant applications from our lab (over $2.2 million since the lab started 6 years ago). The list of unsuccessful ones is rather longer.
 2015: NSF: CAREER Reducing barriers for comparative methods (5 year grant)
 2015: NSF: Co-PI on Collaborative Research: ABI Development: An open infrastructure to disseminate phylogenetic knowledge (3 year grant)
 2013: NSF: PI on Population genetics-based codon models (3 year grant).</description>

      <description>Lab members should review these; we are all expected to follow the guidelines. The University official policies are here; in the case of any conflicts, University policies apply. My goal here is to highlight the most relevant parts for the lab, but we are subject to all of them.
Getting help Depending on the severity of an issue, you could report it to me (directly or using the anonymous feedback form), to the EEB Department Head, or other resources on campus or elsewhere: see below.</description>

      <description>Note you can see a feed of recent articles at Google Scholar; this updates more quickly than this page does. In the lag time between submission and publication, you can see my manuscripts on bioRxiv.
Trait evolution Work in our lab most usually focuses on trait evolution, with most emphasis on methods that allow heterogeneity over the tree. For example, O’Meara et al. (2006) developed a method that allows the rate of Brownian motion to vary over a tree.</description>
