This is Biodiversity 130, Spring 2012. It is a course covering basic evolution and a walk through various taxa. The main site content is set up on Blackboard (behind a log in wall). You may want to check out the [Lampyr](http://lampyr.org) web/iOS app being developed as part of this course. The syllabus is [here](http://brianomeara.info/sites/default/files/Biology130Syllabus_OMearaSpring2012.pdf).
