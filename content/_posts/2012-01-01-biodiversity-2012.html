<p>This is Biodiversity 130, Spring 2012. It is a course covering basic evolution and a walk through various taxa. The main site content is set up on Blackboard (behind a log in wall). You may want to check out the <a href="http://lampyr.org">Lampyr</a> web/iOS app being developed as part of this course. The syllabus is <a href="http://brianomeara.info/sites/default/files/Biology130Syllabus_OMearaSpring2012.pdf">here</a>.</p>

You can adopt these for your own work, with attribution. Note that I have attempted to use only images licensed under such terms myself, but you should take care, especially with images from papers or embedded videos. I have attributed all the media used (with some exceptions for public domain items), and I think this is fair use for education, but I am not a lawyer.
All lectures are available, concatenated, as <a href="http://brianomeara.info/sites/default/files/Bio130_Concatenation.pdf">PDF</a> (344 MB) and <a href="http://brianomeara.info/sites/default/files/Bio130_Concatenation.key">Apple Keynote</a> (3.6 GB).</p>
