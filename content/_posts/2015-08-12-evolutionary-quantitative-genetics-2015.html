<p>This will be my third year teaching in this course, organized by Steve Arnold and Joe Felsenstein. I am teaching about Brownian motion, Bayesian vs likelihood, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Please see the <a href="http://www.nimbios.org/wordpress-training/eqg2/schedule/">ECQ2015 site</a> for more information. Thanks to <a href="http://nimbios.org">NIMBioS</a> and American Society of Naturalists for funding.</p>
