Here is the rubric for the paper:
50: What is known about question, what is work on it (looking for whether it is a good overall summary: presents the current research well, identifies what is known and what is still in dispute, among other factors)
20: What might be done in future (identification of feasible research questions)
10: References (at least three peer-reviewed articles)
20: Writing quality in general (grammar, spelling, etc).
