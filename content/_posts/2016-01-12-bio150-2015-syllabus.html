<p>Here’s my syllabus (<a href="http://brianomeara.info/wordpress_beta/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OMearaBio150Syllabus.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="http://brianomeara.info/wordpress_beta/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OMearaBio150Syllabus.docx">docx</a>) for Bio150. This course is taught in parallel by multiple instructors: we have a shared set of topics to teach, and the same textbook, but then it is up to each instructor to develop her or his section. Mine this semester has 235 students. I will do a mixture of active learning, traditional lecturing, and other activities. In the past I had students use an app I wrote to find local species; this semester I am moving to use <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org">iNaturalist</a> instead. I have created a <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/bio150">project</a> for students to populate with six observations each. They must observe:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A fungus</p></li>
<li><p>A vertebrate that is not a rodent or bird</p></li>
<li><p>An insect</p></li>
<li><p>An invertebrate that is not an insect</p></li>
<li><p>An angiosperm</p></li>
<li><p>A plant that is not an angiosperm</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Grading 1410 observations will be a bit daunting, but I’m planning to use <a href="https://ropensci.org">rOpenSci</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rinat">rinat</a> (written by Vijay Barve and Edmund Hart) to help with that.
I’m also banning laptops or other electronic devices for note taking (except for documented accommodations, of course). I include the justification for this in the syllabus: <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/6/1159">Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014)</a>, which shows that retention is far better with hand-written notes than with a laptop (leaving aside all the distractions from things that aren’t note taking that one can do on a laptop).
I also suggest that students try to see some of BBC’s great recent nature documentaries (Planet Earth, Life, Blue Planet) but did not add a Netflix subscription as a requirement – college is expensive enough.</p>
