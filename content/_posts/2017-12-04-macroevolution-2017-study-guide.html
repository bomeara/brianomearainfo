<p>Study guide/possible exam questions for EEB464 Macroevolution. This focuses on the essay type questions for the exam.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Why may life have been single celled for a long time?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe a major event (such as a mass extinction, colonization of land, etc.) and its subsequent effects.</p></li>
<li><p>How do we learn about organisms with no living descendants, such as trilobites? How would living descendants affect how we can learn about them?</p></li>
<li><p>Can behavior be fossilized? If so, give two examples.</p></li>
<li><p>How can something become a fossil?</p></li>
<li><p>How has continental drift affected the location of organisms?</p></li>
<li><p>Why don’t barracuda eat cleaner wrasse?</p></li>
<li><p>Why bother making phylogenies?</p></li>
<li><p>What is a phylogeny?</p></li>
<li><p>Are species statistically independent?</p></li>
<li><p>How can movement of land lead to speciation?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the Great Faunal Interchange?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe island biogeography. Why is it relevant to this class?</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast pre and postzygotic mating barriers</p></li>
<li><p>What are Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities?</p></li>
<li><p>Compare allopatric and sympatric speciation.</p></li>
<li><p>How might hybrids have greater fitness than their parents?</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the importance of <em>Wolbachia</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the cause of a contemporary group of extinctions.</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a biological trait that may increase extinction risk. Why might it?</p></li>
<li><p>How could phylogenetic diversity be useful for conservation?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe a simple model for species diversification.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare and contrast speciation rate and diversification rate.</p></li>
<li><p>How may trait transitions and diversification rates together affect evolution of a group?</p></li>
<li><p>Which requirement for natural selection is most important? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>What, in the context of this class, is an advantage of sexual reproduction?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe Muller’s ratchet</p></li>
<li><p>Describe one mechanism of sexual selection.</p></li>
<li><p>What is Cope’s rule? Why might it be true?</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast a passive and an active trend.</p></li>
<li><p>How would you detect evidence of a trend?</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast mutualism with parasitism. How can one change into the other?</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a commensalism.</p></li>
<li><p>What is an evolutionarily stable strategy?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is “the good of the species” a problematic concept?</p></li>
<li><p>Why might a prey item call out to a predator?</p></li>
<li><p>What is inclusive fitness?</p></li>
<li><p>What is Hamilton’s rule?</p></li>
<li><p>Give a behavior the idea of inclusive fitness could explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Why can delimiting two species be hard?</p></li>
<li><p>Relate Darwin’s work on reefs to his work on evolution.</p></li>
<li><p>What are some potential reasons that gliding evolves much more often than flight?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does science utilize peer review?</p></li>
<li><p>What evidence links humans to some megafaunal extinctions?</p></li>
<li><p>How did Gould contribute to macroevolution?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the utility of simulation for understanding macroevolution?</p></li>
<li><p>Pasteur showed life does not spontaneously appear. Biologists believe life originally spontaneously appeared. Reconcile these views.</p></li>
<li><p>Use insects as an example of a macroevolutionary process.</p></li>
<li><p>What factors affect evolution of virulence? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>What is domestication? How does it happen?</p></li>
<li><p>Does flight lead to lower extinction risk? What is your hypothesis, and how would you evaluate this?</p></li>
<li><p>Explain how carnivorous plant evolution illustrates aspects of macroevolution.</p></li>
<li><p>How can we assess whether (pre-writing) human arrival in an area led to an extinction of macrofauna?</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example from class of evolution happening in modern humans.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare and contrast a squid, human, and fly eye. Are they homologous?</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a phylogeny of 10 species; label three synapomorphies.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on information from this class, why is there only evidence for one origin of life on the planet?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we reconstruct language evolution?</p></li>
<li><p>How has macroevolution helped us understand aggression in humans [hint: relate back to a class lecture on the topic]?</p></li>
