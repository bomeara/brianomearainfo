<p>Brian O’Meara and Mike Gilchrist in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at The University of Tennessee are currently seeking a postdoc for work with a model uniting nucleotide mutation with selection on amino acids. Aspects of work could include working on extensions to the basic model, applying the model to new biological questions, and/or seeking to speed it up through refactoring the code or putting the model into other software. The labs are based in Knoxville, TN, an area rich in natural beauty, computational resources, and affordability. However, working remotely is possible for candidates with the demonstrated ability to do so successfully. Fourteen postdocs have been mentored in these lab groups: seven have chosen to go onto tenure track faculty positions, two are working in health research positions, four are currently postdocs, and one works in industry. Creating a welcoming and diverse environment is an emphasis of our groups.
