title: U. Minnesota EEB Head
---

In Feb. 2020 I applied for a [position as department head](https://cbs.umn.edu/blogs/cbs-connect/ecology-evolution-and-behavior-seeking-department-head-candidates) for the University of Minnesota Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Department. I have made it to the interview stage in Sept. 2020. Here is information and materials relevant to my application. You may be interested in my [CV](http://brianomeara.info/cv.html) and [people who have been through my lab](http://brianomeara.info/personnel.html).
