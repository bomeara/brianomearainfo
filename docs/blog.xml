<p>Lately I have been getting this error on occasion when running <code>devtools::install()</code> in R:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; devtools::install()
Error: HTTP error 401.
  Bad credentials

  Rate limit remaining: 59/60
  Rate limit reset at: 2023-07-27 21:55:54 UTC</code></pre>
<p>The solution, from <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/unable-to-install-packages-from-github/124372" class="uri">https://community.rstudio.com/t/unable-to-install-packages-from-github/124372</a>, is to do</p>
<pre><code>Sys.unsetenv("GITHUB_PAT")</code></pre>
<p>There have been past reports on this in the devtools package, but it was apparently fixed some time ago. I am using Mac OS 13.4, R 4.2.3. This line does fix it, though.</p>

  <title>Grad core class in evolutionary biology, 2023 edition</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian O&#39;Meara</dc:creator>
  <link>https://brianomeara.info/posts/evolutioncore2023/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Our department has long had a core class: one semester on ecology, one on evolution. It originated before I started here (it was somewhat modeled on UC Davis Population Biology’s core class, which I took as a student, in fact), but I’ve taught parts of it (usually a few weeks on phylogenetics and macroevolution) nearly every year I’ve been here. This year, I took over as the instructor for the evolution semester. Years ago the course was largely team taught with perhaps four or five instructors per semester; over time, this has winnowed down. I chose to do it as the sole instructor, with one guest discussion with Dr.&nbsp;Nina Fefferman on getting grants (she’s <a href="http://feffermanlab.org/funding.html">very good</a> at it), as the students wanted to have a discussion on this.</p>
<p>This course is described as “Readings, lectures, and discussion about key concepts in evolution.” In practice, it has several goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Replace the evolution written exam that was formerly part of qualifying exams (so quals can now focus just on the research project itself). This necessitates broad coverage and robust assessments of knowledge.</li>
<li>Make students fluent in evolutionary thought: students emerging with a Masters or PhD in an ecology and evolutionary biology department should be able to talk about genetic drift, the Modern Synthesis, speciation, and more to people studying evolution, even if the students specialize on some other aspect of science and come with a very different background.</li>
<li>Help students understand how evolution science is done. “Science” is a corpus of knowledge (“the mitochondrion is the powerhouse of the cell”) and is often presented as this in undergraduate courses, but it is also a way to get this knowledge. Students will learn how we gain knowledge in evolution.</li>
<li>Onboarding to the department. This is a particular set of people, assembled with care and at great expense: how to thrive in the department, who people are, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Course structure was based on particular topics, with students typically given a paper or two to read and ask questions about, then work through the topic and questions in class (lots of think-pair-share, class questions, etc.). Students asked for more structure, so I started adding basic slides to give broader overviews of the topics and giving sample final exam questions for each topic so they could better understand the type of depth of knowledge I was expecting them to get.</p>
<p>Often this sort of course covers a lot of history of the field, famous scientists, and the like. I focused instead on current understandings of the topics. This aligns with the course description (“key concepts in evolution”) but I argue that it’s more important for students who are doing their own research: what do we know, and what is still left to learn, rather than who thought what in 1968. That said, there is still vocab people should know in the field, including names of people and organisms, as well as local info (faculty members, Scopes trial, and similar), so I made a <a href="Jargonfest.csv">list of jargon (.csv)</a>, see also Section&nbsp;4, and had some multiple choice quizzes and part of the final to encourage students to learn about these terms.</p>

<p>Given the audience (a course like this is varied: some are students with a Masters degree in evolution, some have had very little biology and come from fields like linguistics, math, or geography), slightly more than half the articles are reviews, while others are particular studies that illustrate what a field can be. I tried to focus discussions on helping with confusing concepts and then talking about why this area of research and its questions can matter. I worked to pull from authors from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives; I’ll be continuing to revisit the set of papers used in the class in the future (and suggestions welcome!).</p>

<section id="sec-accessibility" class="level2" data-number="2">
<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-accessibility"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Accessibility</h2>
<p>Some steps I took to attempt to help with accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerPoint live captioning is great: even when the slide show part of a class was done, I’d leave it open and running so that people can see what is being said</li>
<li>The class was in person, but I always had a zoom stream going. No more than one or two students used it at a time, but it still gave flexibility for those who needed it.</li>
<li>I used clear N95 masks: <a href="https://optrel.us/product/p-air-clear-n95-masks-20-pack/" class="uri">https://optrel.us/product/p-air-clear-n95-masks-20-pack/</a>. They’re more expensive than the regular masks, but they let students see my lips while giving me and them some degree of protection.</li>
<li>Quizzes and tests are not timed (other than a deadline to turn them in, days after they were made available)</li>
</ul>

<section id="sec-programming" class="level2" data-number="3">
<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-programming"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Programming</h2>
<p>We spent one week on programming. My goal was to have students get a bit of exposure and get over initial fear: they’re not going to be writing packages after a week, but they’ll know some of how this all works, that error messages are normal, how to get help, how to start using R and python, etc.</p>
<section id="sec-r" class="level3" data-number="3.1">
<h3 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-r"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> R</h3>
<p>I made an exercise at <a href="https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizR" class="uri">https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizR</a>, focused on this Rmarkdown file (<a href="https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizR/blob/main/main.Rmd" class="uri">https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizR/blob/main/main.Rmd</a>) for students to download; we worked through it in class. You can see it rendered fully here as a <a href="main.pdf">pdf</a>. Some of the basic concepts I wanted them to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rmarkdown for reproducibility and keeping things organized</li>
<li>Installing and loading packages</li>
<li>The importance of actually looking at datasets (using <a href="https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/05/the-datasaurus-dozen.html">datasaurus</a>)</li>
<li>Getting information from online sources like GBIF, iNaturalist, and Datelife</li>
<li>Making maps</li>
</ul>
<p>The script does all this and gives them something to build from. I also gave them links to these resources:</p>

<h3 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-python"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Python</h3>
<p>I’ve barely used any python so far (I’m heavily invested in the R ecosystem) but it’s worth having students learn it: it’s especially important in genomics and machine learning. I thought showing them how to do machine learning could be useful, including having them viscerally feel the issues that could come from image classification. For a sample problem, since I had shown them a local salamander in the R tutorial, and they were interested, I suggested solving a problem of using machine learning to assess whether a sampled individual was a juvenile or adult (<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/27805-Notophthalmus-viridescens/browse_photos"><em>Notophthalmus viridescens</em>, the Eastern Newt</a>) – sort of an “awesome, I can see how this could scale up for my research” inspiration. Thus, I made this exercise (<a href="https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizPython" class="uri">https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizPython</a>), especially this sample script (<a href="https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizPython/blob/main/salamander.py" class="uri">https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizPython/blob/main/salamander.py</a>). I wanted them to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing python libraries</li>
<li>How to import from python libraries</li>
<li>How to point to a folder (directory)</li>
<li>How to do machine learning with a training and testing dataset</li>
<li>How to pull in information from iNaturalist</li>
<li>Possibilities and problems with machine learning results</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the other resources I pointed them to:</p>

<p>Assuming I teach this again in 2024, some of the things I’d like to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued revision of chosen papers: most worked ok, but some got in too much depth; also broader sampling of the literature</li>
<li>More use of overview slides early in the course</li>
<li>More frequent assessments: this could help students self-assess their knowledge over time</li>
<li>Encourage more evenness of classroom participation: everyone contributed, but the evenness could be improved</li>
<li>Add more contemporary human evolution, like the Framingham heart study</li>
<li>Other things students will suggest via their feedback forms</li>
</ul>

  <title>Joining Mastodon</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian O&#39;Meara</dc:creator>
  <link>https://brianomeara.info/posts/joiningmastodon/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Social media keeps changing. I stopped using Facebook years ago (I still have an account, as my kids’ schools and some scientific orgs use it for communication, but I’m not active). I stopped using Twitter in November, 2022, though still keep an account to avoid impersonation (though people could find better accounts to impersonate). I’m now using this blog, but it’s unidirectional – you can read it or not, but I deliberately don’t have any way for people to comment.</p>
<p>I’m increasingly active on Mastodon, and various scientific societies and colleagues are now active there, too. Here’s an overview.</p>
<p>It’s probably easiest to think of Mastodon as</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Similar to an email account: are you <code>example@gmail.com</code> or <code>example@harvard.edu</code>, but now it’s <code>@example@mastodon.social</code> or <code>@example@sauropods.win</code>. People on one provider (“instance” in Mastodon jargon) can generally see information from people on others, unless one of them has put a block on it (in the same way that your email provider may block emails from certain spammy domains).</li>
<li>But set up so that by default you can see what everyone on your instance posts.</li>
</ol>
<section id="it-is-not-a-11-twitter-replacement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="it-is-not-a-11-twitter-replacement">It is not a 1:1 Twitter replacement</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can search for hashtags but not post content otherwise (people sometimes make sites to allow full search, but this is apparently against the norms and there’s pushback)</li>
<li>The algorithm is based on recency only. That <em>is</em> an algorithm, of course – it says people who are active at the same time you are should be prioritized. And it’s better than many other algorithms in social media (“prioritize things that make people angry”, “prioritize posts by the owner”, “prioritize people with the wealth to pay for it”, etc.). But I’d love to see something that prioritizes users I engage with the most even if they have different sleep schedules.</li>
<li>You can “like” or “boost”. Like tells the poster you like something – it does nothing for ranking that or later posts, for you or for others. Boost sends the post to all of your followers and onto your general instance feed.</li>
<li>There is no quote-tweeting. You can reply, or you can write a new post that has a link to the old, but the whole “wrap another post with your commentary” doesn’t exist (yet). This is seen as a way by those influencial in Mastodon as a way to prevent bullying, but taking a screen shot of a post is still possible.</li>
<li>Posts can be edited, easily.</li>
<li>There is a strong culture of including alternative text on images so that those who cannot see the images well know what they are. This is a good thing; do it.</li>
<li>Due to how the instances are organized, they can block one another (“defederate”), just as your email provider could block all emails from a certain domain. This can be a way of blocking from instances that don’t have good moderation.</li>
<li>Anyone can set up an instance; it’s easier than setting up an email provider. However, it’s a lot of responsibility: moderating is HARD.</li>
<li>You can change your instance easily. It’s like moving from hotmail to gmail: you can move your contacts (people you follow), but your posts won’t follow.</li>
<li>Moderation is up to each instance (similar to reddit subreddits). Some do a good job, others do not. And sometimes people may disagree on what moves are important to them. For example, there was a debate a few months ago about defederating from a journalism instance: a user posted a very bad article from a major US newspaper on the instance: should other instances block this whole instance (which has journalists from many media sources) since they allow this sort of post, or should it still be allowed to communicate? The person administrating your server decides (though you may still block individual people on your own).</li>
<li>It still lacks some features important for safety: see <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke/110272951321280411">this thread</a>, for example. Twitter was not perfect, either, and media reports that it is getting even worse, but this does not mean that Mastodon is doing everything right.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="which-instance-to-join" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-instance-to-join">Which instance to join?</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the biggest, and the one run by the main developer, is <a href="https://mastodon.social/about">mastodon.social</a>. It has (as of the date of this post) about 212,000 users. It is a general instance. It’s the one I’m currently on: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@omearabrian">https://mastodon.social/<span class="citation" data-cites="omearabrian">@omearabrian</span></a> . I like it because I use social media to attempt to have reach. It’s also likely stable – it won’t go down if a check bounces or if an admin loses interest. However, see if its moderation works for you. For social media, moderation is a big deal, and it can cover things like hate speech but also things like tone-policing; ignoring vs confronting racism, sexism, homophobia; whether bots are allowed; and more.</li>
<li>A lot of people and journals in my academic sphere are on <a href="https://ecoevo.social/about">https://ecoevo.social/about</a>, which is moderated by <a href="https://www.normalesup.org/~asimon/">Dr.&nbsp;Alexis Simon</a>. It has 1,900 users, including groups like <a href="https://ecoevo.social/@SystBiol">https://ecoevo.social/<span class="citation" data-cites="SystBiol">@SystBiol</span></a>, <a href="https://ecoevo.social/@ASNAmNat">https://ecoevo.social/<span class="citation" data-cites="ASNAmNat">@ASNAmNat</span></a>, <a href="https://ecoevo.social/@sse_evolution">https://ecoevo.social/<span class="citation" data-cites="sse_evolution">@sse_evolution</span></a>, and <a href="https://ecoevo.social/@evol_mtg">https://ecoevo.social/<span class="citation" data-cites="evol_mtg">@evol_mtg</span></a>. It’s also a reasonable place to start.</li>
<li>There’s an instance for bots: <a href="https://botsin.space/about">https://botsin.space/about</a>. I haven’t set up anything there yet, but stay tuned.</li>
<li>There are a lot of other instances. You can find info at <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers">https://joinmastodon.org/servers</a>. Don’t overthink it: at this point, it’s like choosing between gmail and yahoo for email. There is a difference, but not as big a difference as between having email and not having email.</li>

<section id="how-to-find-people" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-find-people">How to find people?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Searching for hashtags is good. You can get a tweetdeck-like interface by going to Preferences -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Enable advanced web interface and turning it on; then you can have columns dedicated to particular hashtags. See who is posting interesting stuff.</li>
<li>You can see who other people are following. I’m following <a href="https://mastodon.social/@omearabrian/following">these people</a> (note that following does not mean endorsement or agreement, just that I want to hear what they say).</li>

<p>Though I’m on mastodon.social, many in my community are on ecoevo.social. So I wanted to follow them all. Here’s R code to do that, using <code>rtoot</code>:</p>
<p>Schoch David and Chan Chung-hong (2023) rtoot: Collecting and analyzing Mastodon data. R package version 0.3.0, <a href="https://github.com/schochastics/rtoot">https://github.com/schochastics/rtoot</a>.</p>
<p>Note that I assume this is all ok, and I have a pause to keep from overwhelming anything, but 1) you will be rate-limited at some point and will have to restart after waiting a bit (but it’ll only follow new people, so you won’t start from scratch), and 2) mass-following could be a scammy thing to do (i.e., someone could mass-follow everyone on a huge instance to try to game getting more followers). I like following ecoevo.social people because mastodon.social’s feed is huge and has lots of things not that interesting to me, while ecoeco.social (and a smaller instance, sauropods.win) does have a lot of interesting users, so I want to follow them. It also hopefully encourages new users: “someone want to hear what you say!”</p>
<pre><code>library(rtoot)

instance_name &lt;- 'ecoevo.social'

my_following &lt;- read.csv("~/Downloads/following_accounts.csv")

user_count &lt;- get_instance_general(instance_name)$stats$user_count
number_of_calls &lt;- min(ceiling(user_count/40),4000)
for (i in sequence(number_of_calls)) {
  people &lt;- get_instance_directory(instance_name,offset=40*(i-1), limit=40, local=TRUE, order="new")
  for (user in people$username) {
    full_user &lt;- paste0(user, '@', instance_name)
    print(full_user)
    if(full_user %in% my_following$Account.address) {
      print("Already following, not going to add")
    } else {
      system(paste0('toot follow ', user, '@', instance_name), timeout=30)
    }
    Sys.sleep(10)
  }
}</code></pre>

  <title>An alternative to CRAN for phylogenetics</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian O&#39;Meara</dc:creator>
  <link>https://brianomeara.info/posts/phylotasticruniverse/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>For installing R packages, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> is the main place to go. It’s a fantastic free service that checks R packages to make sure they meet standards and then compiles them for multiple architectures. It’s largely a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/CRAN_team.htm">volunteer effort</a> and is important to keep packages working together. <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> is a more specialized repository. Getting a package to pass the checks to go on CRAN has long been a point of pride, and it does lead to higher quality packages, though with odd constraints (the overall package size must be small, all examples must run very quickly, and more).</p>
<p>However, <em>keeping</em> a package on CRAN is an issue. Requirements keep changing: will this package work on the development version of R on Debian with a clang compiler, Fedora with a gcc compiler, Mac with both arm and x86 chips, Windows, etc. and continue to do so as operating systems, hardware, and compilers change? For example, our <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_hisse.html"><em>hisse</em></a> package was removed briefly from CRAN in spring 2023 (it’s back online) because of an issue where, while the package passed all checks for Mac, Windows, Linux, all R-devel, R-patched, R-release, and R-oldrel, it would generate a warning if compiled using the <code>-Wlto-type-mismatch</code> flag to GCC. Our code hadn’t changed, and this wouldn’t have affected any users, but CRAN gave us two weeks to fix the warning. We didn’t do it on time, so it was archived, which <em>does</em> affect users (making it impossible for most users on Mac or Windows to use it, for example, as they don’t have compilers installed).</p>
<p>If you are part of an ecosystem, there are further risks. Many phylogenetics packages depend or import <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geiger/index.html"><code>geiger</code></a> – CRAN removed that package, and then two weeks later would have also archived every package that depends on it. Geiger’s authors got it restored in time, but it shows how brittle CRAN’s policies make our community. It’s like the <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">Randall Munroe XKCD cartoon</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://brianomeara.info/posts/phylotasticruniverse/https:/imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency_2x.png" class="img-fluid" alt="XKCD cartoon showing a stack of boxes labeled 'All modern digital infrastructure' carefullly balancing on a small box labeled 'A project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003'"></p>
<p>but with the poor maintainer in Nebraska putting the whole ecosystem at risk if they take two weeks off and there is a new requirement in the interim.</p>
<p>The nature of academia makes this even more precarious. A student might work on a package for their dissertation and others could find it very useful. There is no guarantee that the student remains in the field: it’s not unusual for someone to go into teaching, or working at a nonprofit, or working for a company, and even the weak incentive of getting more citations is no longer sufficiently relevant for them to volunteer their time to meet changing CRAN standards. Ongoing maintenance would be ideal for the field, but it is a high bar.</p>
<p>Fortunately, rOpenSci has made an alternative: <a href="https://ropensci.org/r-universe/">r-universe</a>. This creates a place where R packages can be built automatically for different platforms, just as CRAN does, but in nearly real time. If a package is in an open source repository (the best known is GitHub), and the r-universe instance knows about it, it will try to compile it. Thus, even if something goes off CRAN, students taking a class can likely still install it from r-universe.</p>
<p>To help our community, I’ve created an instance for phylogenetics. The instance is at https://phylotastic.r-universe.dev/ . Information on how to use it is at http://phylotastic.org/phylotastic.r-universe.dev/. For the packages, I’ve used everything from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Phylogenetics.html">CRAN task view for phylogenetics</a> (something I maintained for over a decade, now taken over by <a href="https://williamgearty.com/">Dr.&nbsp;William Gearty</a> who has assembled a team to keep it going), as well as other packages used in phylogenetics in R, including packages in development.</p>

<p>Phylotastic started as an idea launched at the [US] National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, NESCent, in 2012. Over hackathons and other events, and later an NSF grant (written by Arlin Stoltzfus, Enrico Pontelli, and me) it resulted in various tools for phylogenetics (includng http://datelife.opentreeoflife.org/ ). I wanted to keep that connection, not least so that people could use phylotastic R packages even when there are CRAN hiccups.</p>

  <title>Fossils do not help fix diversification parameter estimates</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Jeremy Beaulieu and I have a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syac049">paper</a> in <em>Systematic Biology</em> on the impact of fossils on estimating diversification rates. There has been a lot of interest in the fossilized birth-death process, FBD (<a href="https://doi-org.utk.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.010">Stadler 2010</a>), and with the rediscovery in the field that diversification methods might be telling tales signifying nothing, Jeremy and I thought about how the FBD might help. We know fossils help, a lot, with things like ancestral state reconstruction and dating trees: knowing about fossils might help with diversification processes (especially with parameters relating to extinction).</p>
<p>Jeremy implemented it in <a href="https://speciationextinction.info/"><em>hisse</em></a>. One thing we discussed in the implementation is how there are two kinds of fossils FBD uses:</p>
<p><img src="https://brianomeara.info/posts/fossilsdonothelp/fbd_fig1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Figure 1 from Beaulieu and O'Meara (2022), showing the distribution of fossils on two trees. The left tree shows the sampled fossils; the right plot shows the distinction between parent fossils (ones that have a descendant sample, either a fossil or a tip) and childless fossils (terminal fossils)."></p>
<p>One is terminals that are fossils with no sampled descendants (‘<em>m</em>’ type). The other is parent fossils (‘<em>k</em>’ type): they have a sampled descendant on the tree (which could be a fossil or extant tip). We worried that the methods assume equal probability of sampling for all these fossils, but that empiricists might not be generating data that meet these assumptions. For example, one might put a single <em>T. rex</em> fossil specimen on the tree, but would one put on every individual? All but the most recent one would be parent fossils, and we suspected they could be missing.</p>
<p>We made predictions based on the math, but it’s also useful to test with simulations. Simulations can be tricky when testing models: all models are simplifications of the world that can fail if the world is complex in the wrong ways. One can always write “method X fails under real world conditions Y” if conditions are extreme enough, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will fail in everyday use. So in setting up our simulations for this study, we chose to make it biased towards FBD working and based on realistic parameters. One way we biased it was including mass extinctions: methods using only tip data should do terribly for that, and fossils might help.</p>
<p>The key result is in Figure 4:</p>
<p><img src="https://brianomeara.info/posts/fossilsdonothelp/fbd_fig4b.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Figure 4b from Beaulieu and O'Meara (2022), showing the estimated turnover rate with different true turnover rates and different way of running the analysis. It shows a grouping of box plots, with red lines showing the true values. Using extant data only performed far better than using extant with sampled fossil tips; using all the parent and terminal fossils performed about as well as no fossils at all."></p>
<p>Using just the extant tips (dark purple) performed better than using extant tips and fossil tips (white bars) and similarly to using all the fossils, which based on limited data (see our Figure 3) is rarely done empirically. This surprised us: we were expecting fossils to pretty clearly help except when there was a bias to only use tip fossils. It is frankly a little disappointing that even perfect fossil data (we assumed fossil positions were known exactly, for example) does not help noticeably with estimating diversification models (though they remain important for dating, for ancestral state reconstruction, and likely for tree inference, as well).</p>
<p>To see all the code we used, go to https://github.com/thej022214/Fossils_impact_BO .</p>
<p>To see how to use fossils in <em>hisse</em>, including in models with and without traits, look at Jeremy’s vignette: https://speciationextinction.info/articles/adding_fossils.html . Based on our analysis, fossils don’t help much with diversification, but you can prove us wrong for your data, and you can use these tools for things like looking at correlations where fossils might indeed help.</p>
