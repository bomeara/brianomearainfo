<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Local COVID data</h1>
<h4 class="author">Brian O’Meara</h4>

</div>


<p>Here are notes and links I personally find useful, all gathered in one place. Mostly, I kept looking at webcams to see whether people are practicing social distancing and decided to put them all in one page. I also gather data when nervous, so I also have plots of things like testing, activity, and cases over time so I can see the info directly myself (for example, <a href="https://covid.knoxcountytn.gov/case-count.html#covid_data">Knox County Health Department</a> plots cases per day with a trendline, but so far their trendline is only a straight line - I was curious if a more flexible fitting might be more informative). <b>I am not an epidemiologist</b>, so please do not draw any advice from this page (and I’ve been careful NOT to do projections or anything like that – there is a lot that goes into modeling, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewuo_2pzNNw">this video</a> by my colleague <a href="http://feffermanlab.org/">Nina Fefferman</a>, who unlike me is an expert in this, for more on models). This is just me poking around with the data to make myself feel better – the raw code is <a href="https://github.com/bomeara/brianomearainfo/blob/master/docs/covid.Rmd">here</a> if you’d like to examine it yourself.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>The following plots are created in R using data from <a href="https://covid19datahub.io" class="uri">https://covid19datahub.io</a> (Guidotti, E., Ardia, D., (2020), “COVID-19 Data Hub”, Working paper, doi: 10.13140/RG.2.2.11649.81763), as well as information from Google and the <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html">state of Tennessee dataset page</a> and plotting and analysis using the <code>forecast</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, <code>reshape2</code>, and <code>dplyr</code> packages. Plots created on 2021-08-23 21:29:12. I use a seven day rolling average for most plots using the <code>geom_ma</code> function of <code>tidyquant</code>.</p>
<h2 id="cases">
Cases
</h2>
<p>The number of new should be not be going up if things are well-controlled, and ideally should be going down. I used to plot active cases, but how those are tracked has changed (it used to be based on recoveries, now it’s just a two weeek lag of active). This uses data from <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html" class="uri">https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html</a>. The number of new cases per day seems to align fairly well, but not perfectly, between the state and county data.</p>
<p>I plot five regions (though for simplicity, for some of the plots I omit East TN, and regions with no data automatically do not get plotted for certain measures)</p>
<ul>
<li>Knox County (which includes Knoxville)</li>
<li>Anderson County, which includes the town of Oak Ridge</li>
<li>East TN (the 14 counties that have acute care hospitals in Knox County/East Region according to Knox County)</li>
<li>UTK Student Testing, from tests done at the UTK student health center</li>
<li>UTK Reported, from all cases UT includes on their dashboard (student cases from the health center, cases reported from tests off campus that are communicated)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summarytable">
Summary table
</h2>
<p>We can summarize all this information into a table showing the percentage of different populations who have gotten covid, died from covid, and been vaccinated against it to check for disparities. In many categories there is a substantial unknown, so the numbers in those areas might be low: for example, if 20% of the people being vaccinated have no race recorded, then adding up all the proportion of people in the race categories who are vaccinated will be lower than the total vaccinated. This is why, for example, the proportion of people with positive covid tests by race is lower than any grouping by sex: there are a lot more unknowns in the race category, and I don’t want to assume that the distribution of the unknowns matches the distribution of knowns. I am also treating as unknown categories that seem to have issues, such as mulitracial (very different count by the census than by the TN data) and other for sex in some data (gender is a spectrum, but the available data treat it as binary usually and call it sex; I follow this convention in the source data).</p>

Comparing last academic year with this academic year
</h2>
<p>In the over 20 months since covid started spreading we have learned a lot: vaccines are now available (in the US), we know masks help, and so forth. However, the virus continues to evolve, too.</p>
<p>We can look at hospitalizations over time: <img src="covid_files/figure-html/dejavuhospitalization-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Or deaths over time:</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/dejavudeath-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Or positive covid cases:</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/dejavucases-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see how students age 5-18 (so equivalent to K-12, generally) have had positive cases in East Tennessee.</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/dejavuschoolkids-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="schools2021">
K-12 Schools
</h2>
<p>Cases are growing in local schools. Oak Ridge schools, in Anderson &amp; Roane Counties, started on July 28. The plots below show those Oak Ridge schools that have had at least one student covid case in the 2021-2 school year.</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The plot below shows the proportion of students with active covid cases at any one time. The gray boxes show the region where Oak Ridge Schools considered mandatory masking. Willow Brook Elementary had mandatory masking put in place starting Monday, Aug. 9, 2021. Jefferson and Robertsville Middle Schools had mask mandates put in place starting Monday, Aug. 16, 2021. In response to Gov. Lee’s executive order 84 allowing parents to opt out of mask mandates, on Wed., Aug. 19, 2021, Oak Ridge Schools <a href="https://oakridgetoday.com/2021/08/20/oak-ridge-schools-will-not-require-masks-after-governors-order/">chose to eliminate all mask mandates</a>. However, mask mandates (though with parental opt outs) were reinstated at a <a href="https://oakridgetoday.com/2021/08/23/oak-ridge-schools-approves-mask-mandate/">school board meeting on Aug. 23, 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html">CDC</a> and the <a href="https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/07/18/schools-071821">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommend that everyone in schools over the age of 2 wear a mask.</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>

<h2 id="vaccination">
Vaccination
</h2>
<p>Tennessee releases information on demographics of individuals getting vaccinated. All terminology follows that used by the state, including terms like race and sex. The way the census and Tennessee count individuals who identify as not being in Asian, White, or Black or African American groups (people who are multiracial, Native American, Pacific Islander, other) seems to differ in ways that make calculating the percentage of members of the these groups difficult; the same happens for people who do not identify as male or female.</p>
<p>You can also look at rates for counties like <a href="https://vaccication.org/counties/Knox_TN.html">Knox</a> or <a href="https://vaccication.org/counties/Anderson_TN.html">Anderson</a> on my <a href="https://vaccication.org">vaccication.org</a> site (made for people considering travel during summer 2021, before delta started spreading, to see how safe different counties would be, with look up by place names, too (so you can see what it is like at <a href="https://vaccication.org/counties/Orange_FL.html">Disney World</a> without knowing its county)).</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/vaccination1-1.png" width="672" /><img src="covid_files/figure-html/vaccination1-2.png" width="672" /><img src="covid_files/figure-html/vaccination1-3.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>One concern has been changes in the number of people getting vaccinated over time. These plots show for each demographic group the percentage of individuals in that group getting fully vaccinated (7 day rolling mean). There has been an expansion of who can get vaccinated: adults in high risk categories, all adults, children age 12 and up. These plots show the dramatic decrease in demand for getting vaccinated, despite the proportion of fully vaccinated people being well below what is recommended. The vaccination capacity is clearly higher than demand at the moment.</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/vaccination_increase-1.png" width="672" /><img src="covid_files/figure-html/vaccination_increase-2.png" width="672" /><img src="covid_files/figure-html/vaccination_increase-3.png" width="672" /></p>
<h2 id="cdc">
Cases locally
</h2>
<p>This shows cases locally. I’m zooming in on the most recent months: the huge peak around January 2021 obscures the current dynamics otherwise.</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/plots_new_cdc-1.png" width="672" /><img src="covid_files/figure-html/plots_new_cdc-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Tennessee now breaks out covid test results for school age children (age 5-18). The number of tests in this age group and the underlying population size aren’t known to me, so things like positivity rate and proportion of students infected cannot be determined, but the raw number of students infected can be shown (doing a seven day average):</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/studentinfections-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="hospitalization">
Hospitalization

<p>As of the last time the data were updated (likely 4 days ago), regional hospitals had 7 ICU beds available of 317 total (so was at 98 percent capacity), and 200 available ventilators out of 398 total, (so was at 50 percent capacity). The hospitals overall had 350 beds available of 3076 total (so was at 89 percent capacity). This is based on 19 acute care hospitals in the East TN region; based on the 14 counties these hospitals are in, these serve at least 1,235,720 people. When a line hits 100% (indicated in red), the local hospitals are theoretically full for that resource (for <em>all</em> patients, not just covid patients), though there is surge capacity on top of this. Note that these data are updated only weekly, so current conditions maybe be much better or worse than these plots show. Data on capacity from Knox County’s dashboard, data on hospitalizations and testing over time from the state data.</p>

<p>Another question is what is happening at UTK. There is official information available at <a href="https://www.utk.edu/coronavirus/guides/data-monitoring-and-contingency-options" class="uri">https://www.utk.edu/coronavirus/guides/data-monitoring-and-contingency-options</a>. CDC guidance for institutions of higher education who don’t require vaccination, which includes UTK, is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html#section3">here</a>. There are also CDC recommendations for everywhere, not just higher education: Knox County is currently an area with substantial to high covid spread, so <strong>the CDC recommendation is that everyone wear masks indoors, even those fully vaccinated</strong>.</p>
<p>UTK is releasing <a href="https://www.utk.edu/coronavirus/guides/data-monitoring-and-contingency-options/">some data</a>, though less than some peers or UTK itself last academic year. I cannot find information on number of tests at the student health center, test positivity rate, saliva testing, or wastewater testing. There is no data on vaccination rate in the student body in general or in faculty or staff, nor on hospitalization or death rates. Students in university housing, and their close contacts who are unvaccinated, may have to seek alternate places to live at their own cost if they test positive for covid until the self-isolation period is over.</p>
<p>The first plot shows the percentage of students and employees with active covid cases <em>known to UTK</em> at any one time. I am curious about the overall trend in each, as well as about which group has more reported cases at the moment. One guess could be that covid proportion might be higher among students (high density housing, generally lower vaccination rate for younger populations), but they might get tested at lower rates. Approximate total population size in each group comes from the Chancellor’s update of Aug. 19, 2021.</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/utk2021-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There is also data on those who have reported that they are self-isolating due to having covid (isolation) or being exposed (quarantine).</p>
<p><img src="covid_files/figure-html/utk2021isolations-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From Aug. 2, 2021, to August 22, 2021, UT’s policy was for masks to be worn in classrooms, labs, and during indoor mandatory training events. Spaces like hallways, dining halls, elevators, and libraries were not included in this requirement, in contrast to the CDC’s recommendations in order to <strong>protect others and themselves</strong> by wearing masks in all indoor spaces. On Aug. 23, 2021, UT instituted a mask mandate in all indoor spaces except for private indoor spaces, dining, and other limited exceptions. Unlike <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19">over 650 other colleges and universities</a>, UTK has no vaccination mandate in general (there may be exceptions in particular areas, like nursing with high patient contact). According to an <a href="https://chancellor.utk.edu/2021/08/02/updated-covid-guidelines/">Aug. 2 notice by the Chancellor</a>, the university will no longer be requesting saliva testing to track spread (though testing kits are available in the student health center). I do not know of data on vaccination rate at UTK; a rough estimate may come from LSU, which as of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/08/06/college-covid-vaccines-student-rates/">Aug. 2 had a 34% vaccination rate among students</a>.</p>

<p>In the 2020-2021 school year, UT published results of saliva tests. ALL students residing in dorms, fraternities, or sororities agreed to testing. This table shows testing results of saliva tests:</p>
<iframe width="600" height="225" src="https://datastudio.google.com/embed/reporting/dd6254bd-e3f4-4636-9fc8-3116bc64e033/page/auKkB" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>We can also use the UTK saliva data to estimate the number of new cases in the 2020-2021 school year: the proportion of students who ultimately test postive out of those tested by the saliva scans. Given poor compliance, the true proportions may be much higher than this (if students want to endanger others by not isolating, they may avoid testing if they think they have been exposed).</p>
<p>I am converting the saliva test info to new cases per 100K. I am adopting the assumption that Knox County uses that new cases are only active for 14 days, so I’m computing the new case estimate as 1/14 the active case estimate. I include the 95% confidence interval for the estimate of new cases per 100,000 people, though this is an underestimate of the uncertainty (are dorms good random samples or are results clustered, are students who refuse testing similar to those who get tested, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Note this is for the 2020-2021 school year</strong>: to my knowledge, there is no such data gathering planned for 2021-2022.</p>

<p>We can also see the compliance rate of students with testing. For 2020-2021, all students signed a pledge showing their willingness to abide by community standards. Those in residence at UT agreed to saliva testing.</p>
