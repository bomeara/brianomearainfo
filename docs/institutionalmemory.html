<p>I have been in this area for over a dozen years, so I have seen some
changes through time. For new folks coming in it can be hard to
understand the history, but history is important in knowing what has
been tried, what people are responding to, and just in understanding
this community. I typically use wayback machine links so people can see
the documents as they were.</p>

The UTK Provost’s Office has distributed <a

its Office for Diversity following defunding from the state. This was
prompted by a post from the office arguing for inclusive celebrations
(rather than have a government organization celebrate Christmas or other
religious holidays) that <a
href="https://www.utdailybeacon.com/news/article_11f1ea26-9abf-11e5-b399-dbe3c1a90cb1.html">some
objected to</a> as well as a post that mentioned that not everyone uses
gendered pronouns (again resulting in <a
href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/09/08/u-tennessee-withdraws-guide-pronouns-preferred-some-transgender-people">pushback</a>).
In both cases the university quickly took down the posts.</li>

LGBTQIA+ unfriendly of 488 universities</a> by the Princeton Review.
This is based on asking students how much they agree with the statement
that “students treat all persons equally, regardless of their sexual
orientation and gender identity/expression”. UTK suggests a better
indicator is the <a

<div id="policing" class="section level3">
<h3>Policing</h3>
<p>There are many levels of police here: UTK has its own police force,
the city of Knoxville has its own force, Knox County has its own force,
and there are also state police (and various federal agencies). One
thing that seemed unusual to me coming from Boston was that the county
basically operates like a city: both the county and city have their own
mayors, they set rules for zoning in their respective areas, etc.</p>

<h4>Snail darter</h4>
<ul>
<li>TVA was building the Tellico Dam, with the project starting in
1966.</li>
<li>In 1973, UTK faculty member David Etnier discovered a new species
where the dam was being built by doing a survey with students of the
area that would be affected. He described it (formally naming it
according to the rules of species taxonomy), worked with others to get
it listed under the shiny new Endangered Species Act, and publicly
advocated for its salvation.</li>
<li>UTK law student Hank Hill, UT law prof Zyg Plater, and college of
law assistant dean Don Cohen filed a federal suit to stop the dam.</li>
<li>The suit went up to the US Supreme Court – where <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/16/archives/high-court-bars-dam-reprieving-rare-fish-but-justices-hint-congress.html">Hill
et al. won</a>, stopping the dam.</li>
<li>Senator Baker (Baker Center namesake) and Senator Culver (Iowa)
sponsored an Endangered Species Act amendment creating the “God Squad”
or “God Committee” – a committee that can choose to allow the extinction
of a species by exempting a federal agency (perhaps not coincidentally,
such as TVA) from Endangered Species Act requirements.</li>
<li>The amendment passed; the committee met; the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/01/27/dollars-darters-and-no-dam/05441f0b-8692-4ba5-bce5-57189ecc8e9c/">committee
rejected TVA’s arguments largely on economic grounds</a>, leaving the
dam project stopped.</li>
<li>Senator Baker added a rider to a 1980 appropriations bill that
exempted Tellico Dam from the Endangered Species Act. It passed.</li>
<li>The dam was completed, the lake began to fill, and 20 species
(according to the <a
href="https://www.tva.com/about-tva/our-history/built-for-the-people/telling-the-story-of-tellico-it-s-complicated">TVA</a>)
were eliminated from the impounded river….</li>
<li>… but not from the planet (yet). Among them was the snail darter,
which had been transplanted to a nearby river (and later, other
populations were found). And now, the darter has recovered enough to be
taken off the endangered species list.</li>

<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>Major sports here are men’s football, women’s basketball, and men’s
basketball (men’s baseball is recently very popular, too). The teams
compete in the SouthEastern Conference (SEC). They are generally called
the Vols or Volunteers. There is tremendous fan support for the
teams.</p>
<div id="mens-football" class="section level4">
<h4>Men’s Football</h4>
<p>The football team’s record is available <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tennessee_Volunteers_football_seasons">here</a>
– note especially the orange and yellow rows when they won the national
and conference championships, respectively. If they win half their
games, they generally get to go to a bowl game. The quality of opponents
can vary (some opponents are paid to play and the UTK team is expected
to win many of those games) – the record against conference opponents is
considered a better assessment of how the team is doing that year (and
the SEC is one of the most difficult conferences). The Vols were one of
the powerhouse teams for many years, then declined, but there is hope
again this year (Fall 2022). The football coach is traditionally the
highest paid employee of all state employees. Football coaches generally
sign on for multiyear contracts: if fired they generally keep being paid
(unless fired for cause, <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221021222111/https://www.knoxnews.com/story/sports/college/university-of-tennessee/football/2021/01/18/jeremy-pruitt-fired-tennessee-football-coaching-search-vols/6413502002/">as
happened in 2021</a>), and if someone else tries to hire them away there
generally is money paid to UTK in compensation (making hiring them away
more expensive for competitors). UTK has a history of <a
