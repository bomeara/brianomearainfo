Basic info when setting up a new one (modifying heavily from Bob Rudis’ example here):\n\nTurn on, create initial account, register with UTK.\nCreate temporary account with admin privileges.\nRestart in this account, then use Migration Assistant to copy existing lab accounts and files from existing computer.\nUpdate all software (Mac App store)\nInstall Xcode from the Mac App store.\nOpen the Terminal.app in /Applications/Utilities.\nInstall xcode command line tools by entering the following command in Terminal. [note: do the same for all commands listed in boxes: copy them, paste them in Terminal, hit return].\nxcode-select –install\nInstall homebrew. This is a package manager for Mac (there’s a linux version, too) that makes it easy to install applications with complex dependencies (alternatives are MacPorts and Fink, though I’ve found this most helpful). It’s a bit too cutesy with the “homebrew” aspect (tap, cask, caskroom, etc.) but it works well.\n/usr/bin/ruby -e “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)”\nIt will ask for  you password at that stage\nThen install necessary things\nbrew install svn brew install git brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz\nIt will ask for your password in the xquartz install\nbrew cask install java brew tap homebrew/science brew install R\nThis step will take some time. Now, install other useful things like RStudio and MacTeX. This can take some time (MacTex is HUGE)\nbrew install Caskroom/cask/rstudio brew cask install mactex\nPassword again for mactex.\nbrew install libsvg curl libxml2 gdal geos boost R CMD javareconf JAVA_CPPFLAGS=-I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers brew tap caskroom/fonts brew cask install font-fira-code brew cask install iterm2 brew install r-gui brew linkapps brew tap jonchang/biology brew install -v treepl brew install r8s brew install raxml brew install revbayes brew install phylip brew install phyutility brew install phlawd\nYay, now we’ve installed almost everything we need. Now let’s get R a bunch of packages and configure things. First, set our CRAN repo:\necho “r &lt;- getOption(‘repos’); r[‘CRAN’] &lt;- ‘https://cloud.r-project.org/’; options(repos = r);” &gt; ~/.Rprofile\nNow start installing packages\nRscript -e “install.packages(‘devtools’)” Rscript -e “install.packages(‘ctv’)” Rscript -e “ctv::install.views(c(‘Phylogenetics’, ‘Optimization’, ‘HighPerformanceComputing’, ‘ReproducibleResearch’, ‘WebTechnologies’))”\nWhen you’re done, you can periodically ‘brew update’ and ‘brew upgrade’ to get new versions of your installed software."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was up for tenure in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the U. of Tennessee, Knoxville, over the 2014-2015 school year. This involves being evaluated at the department, college, and university level for a history of research, teaching, and service. If ultimately approved (it was in my case), it results in great job security (though not absolute, which is probably good); if rejected, it results in a year to find another position before being fired. There is a tenure dossier prepared by the candidate and then added to by the department head. The head writes their own letter as well as solicits letters from external senior faculty regarding the candidate’s research. I do not have ready access to the final dossier (though, given Tennessee’s sunshine laws, everything, including letters, is available by request), but I do have access to the parts I wrote. I include it here as a PDF; note I have redacted a section about students on whose committees I have served (there are many in various departments).\nI also gave a tenure talk to the department on Nov. 7, 2014.\nNote in 2019: This is kept online in case it helps others going up for tenure to have a template. Remember the bias we often have when looking at things like this: many of us tend to focus on the things where we’re “not as good” as the template, but ignore the many cases where we are actually “better.” I’m not sure that this particular document will create such feelings, but know that it’s likely I’d feel the same reading your packet.\n\nTenure packet PDF\nSlides as PDF (part 1, part 2, part 3)\nSlides as PowerPoint (76 MB)\nVideo recording of talk is here on YouTube. Note that I was fairly ill during and in the lead up to the talk, so there is a lot of coughing (the wrong kind of “hackathon”). This is the only recording of the teaching, service, and overview parts of the talk, but you can hear better versions of the ABC, floral evolution, and phylogeography sections here based on recordings of my other talks on these subjects, using similar slide decks.\n\nOver the course of my time as an assistant professor, I have:\n\nAddressed questions about how species move through landscapes, what limits rates of evolution, predictability of evolution, competition between organisms, and more\nCreation of methods and open software to deal with rate heterogeneity for discrete characters, more flexible ways of dealing with continuous characters, simulating millions of species, examining correlations, and much more\nTaught hundreds of students to think critically and to understand science as a process\nMentored 4 students and 10 postdocs\n28 grant proposals (including 16 full and 5 preproposals to NSF), $1.4M in external funds\nService in improving representation of women in science, Darwin Day outreach, numerous workshops, hackathons, and conferences\n\nTalk animated GIF\n\nSome unusual or key slides from the talk:\n\nFigure showing my integration into this department. The connections within the department were one of the things that made this position attractive, and I have formed many connections since arriving.\n\n\nTeaching load by year (numbers refer to number of semesters I taught that course that year) as well as some external courses (research talks are not included in this list). This semester (Fall 2014) I am teaching an undergrad/grad macroevolution class (~28 students), a speciation seminar (~15 students), co-teaching our graduate core evolution class, and co-teaching a multi-lab discussion group.\n\n\nSupport from various sources as an assistant professor: PI on two NSF grants, Co-PI on a third, plus funding from various other grants (iPlant, EOL, and others) which have all been very helpful.\n\n\nA tongue-in-cheek artist’s depiction of the Council of the Society for Systematic Biologists. I am an elected member of this council as just one of my service activities, which include co-organizing Evolution 2014, iEvoBio, and Phylotastic hackathons, being the faculty advisor for Darwin Day Tennessee, organizing various initiatives to improve diversity in science, maintaining the CRAN Task View for Phylogenetics, plus various other department, college, and professional service activities.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Scheduling classes can be difficult given limited room availability and various schedule conflicts and constraints. I made a tool for our department to schedule classes for the upcoming semester; others may use it, too. Our hope is that this helps achieve the overall names of balancing room use and student preferences while making sure that instructors have schedules that work for them.\nIts input is an Excel file (.xlsx format) with columns for instructor names, various times, and more (preferences for each instructor are in a row). This is most easily created with a Google form, then exported. This is then parsed by a program (written in R) to compute multiple possible schedules. These schedules are ranked and the best ones saved to an Excel file again, with one sheet per potential schedule.\n“Best” is complex. This first pass tries to minimize the number of schedule changes from last spring while still hitting the university’s criteria for prime time courses. However, there are other measures built in that can be used. EEB did a survey of students to assess their preferences for times outside the “prime” class times of 9 am - 2 pm. Students were asked: “I would want to enroll in a class offered at this time” for each time; possible answers were Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, or Strongly agree. Average scores for each time could range from -2 to 2. The form for instructors has time options of Not possible, Unwelcome but feasible, Feasible, Preferred, and Ideal. Possible schedules are scored by the percentage of classes that had positive student responses in that schedule as well as by the percentage of classes that had instructors with a “Preferred” or “Ideal” time option. There are other criteria, too: is there a schedule that has fewer class time conflicts, can instructors avoid unwelcome assignments, are classes well distributed between MWF and TR, etc. The output spreadsheet has the raw scores for many measures, and schedulers should use these and human judgements: the “best” schedule from this program might be terrible albeit feasible.\n\nGetting started: Google Forms approach\nThe interactive scheduler is here. The source code for it is here.\nThe easiest way to use this program is to copy our Google form. Go to this link:\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UU4TIdmgG4GtcIsk2JUITbsDhutyUkZS_MXbXsQy4PA/copy\nand it will ask you to copy it to your Google account. In the form edit window, click the Responses tab and click the green spreadsheet icon to create a spreadsheet. You can download the spreadsheet as a .xlsx file as people fill it in and run it in the interactive scheduler tool. Do not change any of the time fields – the exact wording must be correct for the scheduling software to work. It’d be possible to make this more flexible, but this was all written on Sept. 24-25 to get it working quickly, and so it doesn’t have all the features one might want.\n\n\nGetting started: Excel file approach\nAlternatively, you can download this Excel file and fill it in yourself. There are example data you can delete. Do not change any of the time headings. The only valid entries in the cells are exactly Not possible, Unwelcome but feasible, Feasible, Preferred, and Ideal.\n\n\nRunning: online\nThere is an R shiny app here that runs the scheduling program. It’s a bit slow, but it’s easy to use. It will ask you to upload the XLSX file downloaded from Google Forms or created in Excel. When you first load the schedule, it will pause for perhaps a minute while it starts creating schedules – this is normal. There are then parameters you can adjust. When done, click the ‘Download sample schedules’ button to download a spreadsheet with the best schedules. Each time you change a parameter, it will re-run the program and update the spreadsheets.\n\n\nRunning: R\nDownload or fork the repo. You will need to change the sheet_code in line 9 of _targets.R to point to your data (a Google Sheets URL from Google Forms). Or, you can use an Excel file (downloaded or written) and pull that into the workflow: uncomment line 10 of _targets.R, comment out line 9, and make sure line 10 points to your input file location.\nYou will need the packages in _packages.R installed to run the program.\nOnce configured, from within the top level directory, open R, and then source(\"run.R\"). It will create a spreadsheet with the best schedules. You can change where this goes by editing line 15 of _targets.R.\n\n\nGetting help\nThis was made part time over two days to handle an unexpected need to reschedule classes in EEB. It’s being shared with others in the hope it helps, but it could have many bugs or other problems. We’re not really offering a lot of tech support with this, but if you have any questions, please contact Brian O’Meara."

    "text": "Research\nA major duty of a science professor, especially at a research-intensive place like U. of Tennessee, Knoxville, is to expand human knowledge through their research efforts. I work in a variety of areas to do this.\n\nSpecies discovery: One area is figuring out how many species are actually present within a group. We often think of new species being discovered by, say, an astute observer seeing a weird fish in a market, or on an expedition to a remote area of the jungle, but in fact many new species are discovered as a result of data showing that what we thought was one species was actually two different species with limited or no interbreeding: see examples of tapirs or even African elephants. I develop some of the techniques we use to make these discoveries. This matters for basic biology: it is hard for scientists to communicate information without having names for biologically meaningful groups, and it is important to understand what leads to and maintains separate groups, but it also matters in the applied area: it is hard to conserve species properly if we do not recognize what they are (we might wipe out a species that we didn’t realize was independent, or might devote resources to saving a “species’ that is actually just a variant of a common species and lose another species due to finite resources).\nI also develop methods for looking at past history of life. For example, we have methods that can give information about how species have multiplied through time: do they exchange genes for a long time, has their population crashed at some point in the past, etc. This helps us understand how the current world came to be, but also may be useful in predicting what will happen as life and the environment continue to change.\nOne major research focus has been developing approaches for looking at how and why traits change over time. For example, if you look in many environments you see more flowering plants than nonflowering plants like pines and ferns – why is this? Or questions like, once most of the dinosaurs (birds survived) went extinct, did mammals’ body size rapidly increase or was it gradual?\nOne way I accomplish my research goals, as well as help others, is by writing software. It’s one thing to have an idea of how to solve a problem, but if you write a program to do this, then you and others can actually use the method to solve a problem. My software is free and open source. This means anyone can use it without paying me money (which makes sense, as my work has already been directly or indirectly paid for by taxpayers). It also means that anyone can look inside the software to see how it works. For example, here is an example of some of the code I wrote as a grad student; you can see how people have used it by looking at the hundreds of articles that cite it (though some are citing just the method, not using the software itself). Another important aspect of open source software is that not only can you look at it, you can build on it to make new software, without needing my permission, as long as you make it clear that you’re reusing my software, give appropriate credit, and release your software under the same rules (allowing reuse, showing the code, etc.). Building on others’ work, while giving them credit, is one of the key ways science advances. Making software open also lets others check for errors and try to reproduce studies.\n\nThere are various other research topics; look here for more info.\n\nResearch Funding\nThis research requires funding to move forward. In some ways, running a lab is like running a small business (my father cofounded and ran a small print shop, so I have seen some of what this entails). You need some money to get it off the ground for necessary equipment, people, and space. After that, potential clients have needs, and you have to make the case that you’re the best group to fulfill those needs: evidence that you can make a great cake for their wedding, design a building that will get their company noticed, or reliably cut their grass twice a month. Seed funding in science typically comes from the university; at the time a faculty member is hired, there is a negotiation between the university and the candidate over what is needed for the faculty member to be successful. That money typically has to be spent down in two or three years to get the lab off the ground. After that, money comes in from clients. The typical client in my area is the US government’s National Science Foundation. It puts out calls for work in particular areas: programs to train students, software to take advantage of massive investments in computers and sensors, or data to get more information on how life has changed over time. Hundreds of scientists turn in written proposals in response to each call, often including preliminary work to show the feasibility of their proposal. Other scientists review these proposals and evaluate them on the basis of two main criteria: intellectual merit and broader impacts. Intellectual merit is things like the importance to science of what the work will do and feasibility of the work. Broader impacts is benefit to society: improving commercial companies, providing information important for policy decisions or national security, improving the nation’s infrastructure for research and education, or helping to make participants in science more representative of the country as a whole. The NSF then takes these scientists’ opinions of the proposals into account, but also other considerations (making sure scientists just starting out have a chance at funds, for example), and decides which scientists get the grants. NSF requires annual reports to monitor progress; for big grants, it may do more intensive oversight (like sending scientists out to do a site visit at where the science is being done). The university typically takes about a third of each grant to cover ongoing infrastructure and other costs associated with supporting scientific research; the rest goes into equipment, travel and salaries (sometimes including salary for a professor: we typically get paid for nine months of work and can get paid out of a grant to work over the summer (which, frankly, nearly everyone does anyway, even without a grant: continuing to do experiments, write up results, mentor grad students, etc)). You can see an example of one of my funded proposals (including the broader impacts, scientific impact, and detailed budget), here (PDF). Funding is very competitive: in my areas, funding rates may be as low as 8%, meaning for every twelve grants applied for, you might get one (and some major programs limit people to no more than two grants per year, so it can take years to be successful). I have been very lucky in getting grants. For example, in one main program at NSF, the Division of Environmental Biology, 11,789 people applied for grants from 2006-2014; only a quarter got any grants. In terms of number of grants, I was tied for 15th place out of 11,789 applicants (four grants: a dissertation improvement grant and three regular grants; I’ve since gotten another grant from a different part of NSF, and a CAREER grant from NSF). [This isn’t a way scientists usually think about such things, by the way – there’s a large amount of luck involved in getting grants once you’re in the tier of good proposals, so there’s really no reason to assume that someone with three grants is doing better or more work than someone with no grants; we usually focus much more on scientific outputs (ideas, papers, software, data, students produced), which are what really matter. However, for a general audience, this measure might be more intuitive]. In addition to their main role in supporting science, these grants help Tennessee’s economy; the approximately $2.2M of funds I have been awarded over the past six years are predicted to create about 53 jobs (using a rough estimate from here). Less approximately, my funding has directly supported four scientists and their families in Knoxville, all drawn here to work on this science."

    "text": "Teaching\nOf course, another major role for faculty is teaching and mentoring. I teach introductory biology courses of around 200 students covering ecology, evolution, and an overview of life’s diversity. I created a mixed senior- and graduate-level course on major themes and ideas in evolution that I teach to about 30 students annually. This was inspired in part by a similar course I was lucky enough to take from Steve Gould and Dick Lewontin as an undergrad. I teach part of our introductory course for graduate students, covering why we can use phylogenetics to understand ecology and evolution and how to do so. I also teach numerous smaller seminar-style courses mostly for graduate students. Last year (Spring 2016) I taught a 235-student introductory biology course as well as created a new, online and in person graduate course in phylogenetic methods, where materials (exercises, videos) are free to all to use. Scientists often go around the world giving talks on their research; I do that, but I also do short workshops for training in software or methods to students in places like Brazil, Sweden, Switzerland, Ohio, North Carolina, Louisiana, and even here in Tennessee. I also talk to students in local elementary schools. I also mentor students. Undergrads can learn to do research in my lab (given my rather theoretical work, few of our biology students have opted in to this, but there have been some notable exceptions): I help them design projects and then help them gain the skills to address them. I have four PhD students in my lab (one is coadvised with another faculty member) who get more intensive training and even more independence. Graduate students also form a committee of, in our department, typically four faculty members including their main advisor. Their committee helps advise them in aspects of their work where an outside view can be helpful and helps maintain academic standards across a program. I currently serve on approximately a third of our department’s grad students’ committees, as well as for students outside our department. Finally, I mentor postdocs. These are scientists who have their PhD and thus extensive research experience but who do not yet have a permanent position. Mentoring can include expanding their skill sets into a different area of biology or math, helping them put their work in a broader context, and helping them apply for faculty jobs or for jobs outside of academia. I have mentored eleven postdocs so far. Slightly more than half were funded by the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS), which is housed at UT Knoxville campus (and which has resulted in over 400 scientific publications, 4900 visits from mathematicians and biologists from all over the world, and $35M of federal funding into Tennessee), and the remainder from support from my own grants or other funds."

    "section": "Service",
    "text": "Service\nThe third part of my job is service. These are things that are key to proper functioning of a department, or serve a purpose outside of our department, but aren’t directly research or teaching. For example, our department is attractive to grad students (good mentors, opportunities for important research, guaranteed support to students making adequate progress) and so we receive far more applicants than we can admit. I help decide which of these applicants we can admit, based on their application info (letters of rec, research experience, application essays, and other information) and factors in our department. Peer review is critically important in science: before getting something published (or a grant funded) other scientists in the field (in some ways, your competitors) have to volunteer their time, usually anonymously, to review your work and suggest changes before it can be published. These scientists don’t get paid for this; it’s just accepted as one of the duties that come with the job. It’s as if Toyota couldn’t start selling its new minivan until engineers at Honda, Chrysler, and Kia had finished checking it out and making recommendations about it. This can be a painful process, but it can really make the final work that gets published better. I participate as a reviewer for many scientific journals as well as funding agencies. Outreach is also a part of service; I do this through advising the student group Darwin Day TN, maintaining an overview of software for phylogenetics in R, helping to organize scientific conferences, and many other activities."

    "title": "Should you go to grad school to be a professor?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A key question I get from advanced level undergrads is whether they should go to grad school intending to be a professor. I also tell prospective students in my lab some of the benefits and costs of choosing this career path. Here I am compiling some of this information; note that this is my personal view.\n\nPros\n\nYou get PAID to go to grad school. This isn’t universally true, and sometimes it’s only for PhD, but it’s fairly common in evolution and ecology in the United States. The pay\nIf all goes well, you get to pursue your passion: if you care about how anoles in Cuba feed, you can spend your life studying that; or figuring out how Ebola spreads, what conditions are required for life to evolve, etc. This is a huge benefit: very, very few humans are privileged enough to follow their passions as the core of how they make their living.\nYou contribute to human knowledge. Matt Might has a good visual for this. If all goes well, you bring information to humanity that we didn’t know (which can include a discovery that what we thought we knew was wrong). It is pretty amazing to live a life at the boundary of knowledge and ignorance and to be one of the people pushing this boundary outward.\nYou teach. Imagine teaching an intro bio class to non-majors. This may be the last chance many of them have to learn about the reality of evolution, the causes of climate change, how bacteria evolve in response to antibiotics, how nitrogen affects the ecosystem, and more – and it’s up to you to do this well.\nStandard of living in a faculty job: faculty aren’t paid what people with their degree of training might get working on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley, but it’s a solid middle class or upper middle class salary, typically in an area with good schools, health care, etc.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nYou might not get to do this, after investing 5 years in a PhD and multiple years as a postdoc. Many people choose to do a PhD for reasons other than pursing a faculty job, and this is great. One thing we need to do better is train people for these vocations (careers in NGOs, government, industry, etc.) within PhD programs, especially since that is where many of our students choose to go. However, there is also a population (the intended audience for this post) who are planning to get a faculty job, but end up not finding one. It’s not unusual to get hundreds of good applicants for an assistant professor position, but only one of them will be successful. And the reason that she or he gets the job is partly overall “quality” (things like publication record, teaching experience, ability to get grants) but it is also largely due to extrinsic factors: need to have someone to teach a particular course, someone with experience working in a certain region, etc. My department (University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Ecology and Evolutionary department) tracks this info for our graduates: after having their PhD for five years, 55% are tenure track faculty, 17% are in government jobs (EPA, etc.), 10% are in non tenure track research or teaching jobs, and so forth. This should give you an idea of probabilities of different outcomes (which is a mixture of choice and constraints); wherever you apply should have data like this.\nWork does not stop. Of course, for the parts of the career that you love, this could be a good thing: it can be fun to read the literature, develop new ideas, make new observations. But you will also have to write grants (about 92% of which will fail, given NSF funding rates), deal with the business of teaching (i.e., answering questions from students that are already addressed on the syllabus), and so forth. You definitely need to take breaks and think about work-life balance, but the pressure is always to work more.\nDanger: for work involving going to remote areas in the field, there is the real risk that you will be injured or killed. See here for a list of naturalists who have died on the job. A study (Clancy et al., 2014) found a very high number of incidences of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the field, with the victims often being trainees.\nDepression: In a recent survey (see article about this here), over 4 in 10 PhD students in biology at Berkeley were assessed to be depressed. Grad school and science in general can be stressful. Frequent failure is a given (rejection from journals, grants, jobs, even (in some ways, especially) for ambitious, successful scientists). You and your work will also be evaluated by peers: do you get a job, get tenure, etc. People who have a different view than yours will go after your work in the literature. This is (often) healthy for science as a whole, but it doesn’t necessarily feel good. Also think about family support. If all goes well, and you’re lucky, you might have your first “real” job as a professor at age 30. You are more likely to be mid thirties or older, especially if you do a masters before PhD, multiple postdocs, etc. What will your parents, partner, etc. say when you still do not have a “real” job at 35, over a decade after you “finished college”?\nStandard of living on the way up: Grad students in many places don’t get paid well. It is school, not a job, but it is also typically five years or more for a PhD in the US, and that’s a long time to be living with little ability to build savings, especially at a time in people’s lives when they often start having children. Postdocs are often underpaid, and have to find and get a new job, in a different part of the world, every year or two. There will also be unexpected expenses (student fees, supplies while you’re in the field, travel to conferences) that might come out of your personal funds (shouldn’t but might). A scary new trend at some universities is eliminating health care plans, including subsidies, for grad students, sometimes with mere days of notice. In addition to avoiding schools like this (unless you have the resources for health care on your own; remember your parents can only cover you until you are 26), you may want to check with schools admitting you about guarantees for health care. Note that non-US universities may have different policies.\nMoving: how many faculty members has your current department hired since you’ve been there in the area you will study? Usually zero or one. If you want to work at college X, it might be 20 years or longer until there is a job opening in an area where your research would make you an appropriate candidate, and there will be 250 applicants for that job. Thus, you have to be ready to move to where a job is. Even if you have a vague geographic preference (southwestern US to be near family, say), there’s a good chance you won’t end up there, at least not for decades. If you are unwilling to move, a PhD in science can be a great idea, but you should definitely consider career paths outside of the faculty track once you have that PhD.\nTwo-body problem: If it’s hard for one person to end up in a place she or he wants, it’s even harder for two. Some places will consider spousal accommodations, but not all will (and it can depend on things like whether your spouse would fit naturally in your college), and it might be far from the ideal position for your partner. Some couples end up in long distance relationships for years.\n\nI am personally very glad I’ve made this choice of career; there are bumps, but overall it has been wonderful. My goal is not to dissuade people from going to grad school, only that you are well-informed about the risks and benefits before you start. My list has more cons, but that doesn’t mean they outweigh the benefits, only that I think they require more explanation: the benefits of a career in science are many and obvious to those with contact with this. Talk to current and past students, find out from the program about their outcomes, talk to faculty and postdocs at your current institution and at where you may go to grad school. Also be sure to find out about alternate careers after grad school: most faculty know best about how to make more faculty, but your passion may lie in starting a conservation organization, working with Congress to pass legislation, designing software for biology education, writing popular books about science, or a myriad of other careers that relate to biology but which do not necessarily lead to a faculty job (or even require grad school).\nI strongly urge people applying to my lab to first read The Professor Is In by Karen Kelsky. It’s cheap ($15 cover price, ~$8 at some retailers) and provides a good, albeit harrowing, overview of how a career with a PhD works now and what strategies will help. Some of it is tailored towards humanities rather than sciences, so check before following all its advice (i.e., getting outside teaching gigs while a grad student is not a good idea for most science students), but it’s a good book overall."

    "text": "The Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant was a beloved NSF program that gave small amounts of money (up to $19K) for projects to enhance the dissertations of PhD candidates. Its cancellation was motivated by programmatic needs at NSF. Each DDIG grant requires as much diligence and work by NSF as a regular grant of hundreds of thousands of dollars; in an environment where NSF had to cut its workload, cutting this program dramatically decreased the number of grants NSF had to handle without impacting overall funding to biology as much as other programs. It is clear the NSF staff involved recognize the utility of the program and deeply regret the need for the cuts. This elimination has resulted in an outcry from the scientific community.  It has been covered in news stories in Science, the Chronicle of Higher Education, The Scientist, and even the Minnesota Daily.  It has also resulted in letters protesting its cut from three major evolution societies, the 10,000 member Ecological Society of America,  faculty at Stanford University, and the American Society of Plant Taxonomists, as well as numerous emails and letters sent from individual scientists to NSF. The National Science Foundation has released aggregate information on the  overall funding and  career trajectories from the DDIG program. There have been a few proposals for replacing the DDIG program: a group led by Maren Friesen, an idea of having awards with DDIG-like subawards, and at least one proposal to have a university handle all subawards. Many scientists have also posted personal anecdotes about the DDIG’s effect on their career, including its substantial return on investment. I have aggregated some of the most compelling below.

I was heavily involved in handling the fallout from issues with a new publishing platform for Systematic Biology: associate editors were being listed as authors, articles that people paid to make open access were being put behind paywalls, DOIs were not working, etc. A description of some of my efforts regarding this is here – it included frequent contacts with the people on our publisher’s team dealing with issues, contacting affected authors, and even a script to check for known problems. I also started SSB’s committee to talk to other publishers, though final negotiations (which resulted in staying with Oxford, but with better terms) were done by SSB’s longtime partners, Burk and Associates (who have far more expertise negotiating).\nI have been concerned about unwelcome and exclusionary behavior in the field. In response to reports of unwelcome behaviors at Evolution in 2017, I (posting as the Society) created a qualitative survey to gather suggestions and reached out to people reporting issues. I then joined the Code of Conduct committee for the three evolution societies (SSB, ASN, SSE), which is led by Andrea Case. That committee has crafted and gotten adopted policies on enforcement of our code of conduct (with feedback from leadership of the three societies), started the Evo Allies program, created an IRB-approved survey of Evolution attendees, presented results of that survey (O’Meara et al. 2019), and written transparency reports (2017 & 2018, 2019) so people can see what is happening and potential areas to improve."

    "text": "Goals\nIf you were to ask biologists, SSB’s selling points are that it puts out a great journal with a harrowingly thorough review process, organizes a wonderful standalone meeting, and contributes to a successful joint Evolution meeting; members receive discounts on all these, and some may be eligible for awards for talks or research. These all represent a tremendous amount of largely volunteer effort, and it’s a testament to the society that these have continued to thrive and even expand. It’s essential to support and nurture these aspects.\nHowever, SSB is more than these: it’s a Society of Systematic Biologists. We’re a community of people with a shared passion for solving questions using systematics. We need to take steps to knit this community together and have members benefit from these interactions. Some goals I would seek to achieve:\nMentoring across institutions: while many institutions are creating mentoring relationships internally, internal power dynamics can still affect how well those work (how honest can an assistant professor be about their concerns about staying in academia to someone who will be voting on their tenure in a couple of years, for example?). A unique aspect of scientific societies is that their membership spans career paths, career stages, and institutions. I would create a system where people could form connections and meet virtually a few times a year, in pairs or small groups, to discuss science, career questions, and more. Importantly, information flow would not be unidirectional – someone with more experience in academia could explore concerns with promotion with a junior colleague, but also learn about new areas of synthesis between ecology and evolution from them, for example.\nSupport joint efforts: Whether it’s support for standards for data types or deposition requirements, areas of interest for grant agencies, or initiatives to get rid of structural barriers that push out people, a society can provide a framework so that it is not a single person working on their own but a collective effort with our membership’s backing. This makes the efforts more likely to succeed but also more likely to be sustained as new people rotate in to continue them.\nMake our society a welcoming, safe place: SSB has no requirements that members behave ethically, nor any guarantees that members won’t see their harasser at the next SSB event no matter how egregious and well-documented the bad behavior. The Code of Conduct helps address this at meetings, and there are efforts to make a Code of Ethics governing behavior in general, but those are still under development, and there are many more ways we can improve."

    "title": "Fossils do not help fix diversification parameter estimates",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Jeremy Beaulieu and I have a paper in Systematic Biology on the impact of fossils on estimating diversification rates. There has been a lot of interest in the fossilized birth-death process, FBD (Stadler 2010), and with the rediscovery in the field that diversification methods might be telling tales signifying nothing, Jeremy and I thought about how the FBD might help. We know fossils help, a lot, with things like ancestral state reconstruction and dating trees: knowing about fossils might help with diversification processes (especially with parameters relating to extinction).\nJeremy implemented it in hisse. One thing we discussed in the implementation is how there are two kinds of fossils FBD uses:\n\nOne is terminals that are fossils with no sampled descendants (‘m’ type). The other is parent fossils (‘k’ type): they have a sampled descendant on the tree (which could be a fossil or extant tip). We worried that the methods assume equal probability of sampling for all these fossils, but that empiricists might not be generating data that meet these assumptions. For example, one might put a single T. rex fossil specimen on the tree, but would one put on every individual? All but the most recent one would be parent fossils, and we suspected they could be missing.\nWe made predictions based on the math, but it’s also useful to test with simulations. Simulations can be tricky when testing models: all models are simplifications of the world that can fail if the world is complex in the wrong ways. One can always write “method X fails under real world conditions Y” if conditions are extreme enough, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will fail in everyday use. So in setting up our simulations for this study, we chose to make it biased towards FBD working and based on realistic parameters. One way we biased it was including mass extinctions: methods using only tip data should do terribly for that, and fossils might help.\nThe key result is in Figure 4:\n\nUsing just the extant tips (dark purple) performed better than using extant tips and fossil tips (white bars) and similarly to using all the fossils, which based on limited data (see our Figure 3) is rarely done empirically. This surprised us: we were expecting fossils to pretty clearly help except when there was a bias to only use tip fossils. It is frankly a little disappointing that even perfect fossil data (we assumed fossil positions were known exactly, for example) does not help noticeably with estimating diversification models (though they remain important for dating, for ancestral state reconstruction, and likely for tree inference, as well).\nTo see all the code we used, go to https://github.com/thej022214/Fossils_impact_BO .\nTo see how to use fossils in hisse, including in models with and without traits, look at Jeremy’s vignette: https://speciationextinction.info/articles/adding_fossils.html . Based on our analysis, fossils don’t help much with diversification, but you can prove us wrong for your data, and you can use these tools for things like looking at correlations where fossils might indeed help.\n\nTo subscribe, go to https://brianomeara.info/blog.xml in an RSS reader.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{o'meara2023,\n  author = {O’Meara, Brian},\n  title = {Fossils Do Not Help Fix Diversification Parameter Estimates},\n  date = {2023-04-22},\n  url = {https://brianomeara.info/posts/fossilsdonothelp/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nO’Meara, Brian. 2023. “Fossils Do Not Help Fix Diversification\nParameter Estimates.” April 22, 2023. https://brianomeara.info/posts/fossilsdonothelp/."

    "title": "Funding for tenure",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the US, science funding is being cut, including the elimination of entire areas of study from federal funding. There are predictions of yet more reductions. This will affect what will be studied, who can study it, and even who survive diseases. Various individuals and groups are working to address this. I want to address just one small part of this where faculty still have (some) control: criteria we use in awarding tenure.\nThe standards for tenure can be opaque to various degrees: we all do teaching, research, and service, and institutions vary in how they weight each of these within the institution and across faculty members. Institutions vary in what constitutes evidence for each. For example, one person might teach a large number of intro classes and have peer evaluation of their teaching, while at a different institution someone may teach a few small enrollment classes and be evaluated on how well they are mentoring grad students. The AAUP has a survey of tenure practices, a quarter-century old book about best practices (probably due for some updating), and a page aggregating additional resources for those seeking to learn more.\nBut imagine if a department had a standard for tenure of using 10,000 pipette tips. Each time you finish a box of tips, you put an empty box against the wall: only 105 boxes total to get to tenure! Of course, this doesn’t work for people doing bird banding, or theoretical ecology, or any of a myriad of research programs. Pipette tips are a tool, not a goal. Within a narrow area they might be an okay proxy for productivity: back when I was sequencing ant DNA my pipette box accumulation rate could have been a good way to spot check how much time I was spending in the ant lab. But it would have been a terrible way to measure how much work I was spending coding new methods or writing papers. And using tips as a criterion could warp the research program: instead of banding birds, someone might have to change the research to do blood draws on captured birds to have a wet lab component, just in order to use enough tips to get tenure.\n\n\n\nEnough boxes to be 38% of the way to tenure? Photo from reddit user strawspiderflower.\n\n\nI suggest funding is the same. It is a tool that enables research, outreach, and more, but it isn’t the goal itself. It’s fantastically useful, of course. I’ve been lucky to work with 17 postdocs so far as a mentor, all of whom needed money for things like food and health care: about half the time, that came from grants I wrote, with the rest of the time coming from grants written by others (thanks, NSF, and the UTK team who wrote the NIMBioS (National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis) grant!). Other people need funding to pay for sequencing, or to fly to Costa Rica to collect insects, or to get a LI-COR to measure leaf respiration. And different research requires different amounts of funding – someone collecting fossils in the Arctic is not a better scientist than someone collecting fossils ten miles away from campus, but the former requires more money (and is generally less accessible to students). If both scientists are publishing good work at the same rate, why do we care that one person had to rent a helicopter and another a bicycle? It gets even more stark between fields: someone doing mathematical models may need far less funding than someone working on cancer research in a general biology department, and they also have access to different funding sources (at least historically, NIH provided more money than NSF), but the department is better for having both of them in the same place.\nThis is a time when there is even less reason to judge people by their funding. Federal funders and others have been cutting off funding for entire subfields. Faculty are pivoting their science to be able to keep doing work that matters. We want to encourage this: let them grow their research program and adapt to the changing world (this does not mean not trying to make improvements, but it does recognize external constraints). Having a performance standard that is based on the quality of science they are communicating makes sense. Adding a second metric, funding, warps that. In evolutionary biology, we teach about tradeoffs: armor is great, so is flight, but we don’t have flying armored turtles. Funding can serve the science, but making it a criterion in itself creates potential tradeoffs between the best science to do and the best science to get funding.\nSuggested action item: Departments should have conversations about criteria for tenure, and explictly discuss, and put in writing, that funding is NOT one of those criteria. Ideally, this should be put into departmental bylaws. The end of the semester is a hard time for this, but faculty are going to be trying to figure out what to do this summer: giving them reassurance about optimizing just for good science will let them focus on this. For some, this will require figuring out funding, but not for all. When people come back together in the Fall, bylaws that mention funding should be amended, as well as similar work at higher levels of an institution. There might be work that correlates with funding (Has a faculty member been able to recruit and mentor grad students? Have they been able to develop modern, publishable datasets?) but the work is what we care about, not the funding itself.\n\nWhat about indirect costs, startup, etc.?\nAn objection to ignoring funding as a criterion for tenure is that grants are ways to support other aspects of the university. It is worth digging into the details of this, though.\nFirst, though it’s an imperfect analogy, it can be useful to compare a new lab to a new coffee shop. To start up a coffee shop, one needs to get a building, equipment, and supplies: everything from flour to make the donuts to a soap dispenser in the bathroom to cups for the coffee. Then one needs to hire and train staff. Only then can one open for business and start making money. For example, for a Starbucks, it costs $315,000 to license a store (which includes some equipment) and one must have $700,000 in cash for other costs. [Note I really wanted to find the similar cost for the far superior Dunkin’ Donuts instead, but it’s not available]. That’s the same order of magnitude as starting a biology lab at a research-intensive university, where startups in the hundreds of thousands of dollars are common.\nOne question any business owner has to face is how much to price each item. There’s the obvious cost of ingredients; there’s also the fractional cost of the employee that makes the coffee: a fancier coffee takes more time and so should cost more. But there are other costs that are harder to calculate. What fraction of a light bulb’s lifespan is used to illuminate the coffee station where the coffee is made? How much of the cash register’s overall cost is each cup of coffee responsible for? What about the person working the cash register? One way to do this would be to measure this exactly for everything: “hot tea” takes less time to say than “regular coffee black with two sugars” so the latter costs more of the cashier’s time. A different approach would be to figure out the obvious costs for the ingredients and direct labor, figure out all the other costs for the entire store, and find a ratio that makes it break even with a little extra for profit. For example, if a small cup of coffee costs $1.00 to make, add 50% to the cost of that to cover all the other costs and charge $1.50; maybe bump it up to $1.59 for a little profit.\nThe same applies for a lab. If one is proposing a project to sequence ant DNA to infer their phylogeny, there’s the cost to go to collect the ants in the field, the DNA extraction kits, PCR reagents, sequencing costs, and more. There’s the cost for the grad student to do the work (stipend, health care, and tuition). These are all calculated ahead of time and charged to the funder. But there are also all the other costs: someone to make sure the lab is run safely, having a building to do the work in, paying to run the -80 ˚C freezer, and more. Rather than figuring out these costs per project, the institution where the work happens negotiates with the federal government about the average overall costs. At a university, every $100 of direct cost might mean $50-60 in indirect costs, so that can be the negotiated rate. For institutions like children’s hospitals, it can be even higher, like 78% at Children’s Hospital Boston.\nThe thing is, the folk wisdom about this (backed by research: Holbrook and Sanberg (2013)) is that universities lose money on this. The indirect costs do not quite cover the cost of the research. In some ways, this is like athletics programs: they only rarely make money, but they help with brand recognition, student spirit, and more. Research is even more central to the mission of a university – universities are about generating new knowledge and sharing it, and funded research is a major part of this. Overall amount of research expenditure is also a metric used in rating or categorizing universities – it looks “good” by metrics some care about to have a lot of research expenditure.\nMoreover, just in terms of earnings per square foot, research labs are a spectacularly bad way to make money. Take the University of Florida, a major research university. As of the latest data (2023), it had 3,884,000 square feet for research and engineering; it also spent (from external funds) $1,250,201,000, for an average of $322 per square foot. A Starbucks has sales of $700/sqft, McDonald’s $2196/sqft, an Apple store $25,000/sqft, and even Walmart is $407/sqft (from here, which is not peer-reviewed). And consider the cost to run a Walmart compared to a bunch of labs with the same total amount of square footage: Walmart has no fume hoods, no centrifuges, few expensive freezers, minimal computers, etc. and yet it only makes about 3% profit on this earnings per square foot. Walmart’s earnings for this space are 25% higher than what U. of Florida brings in with grants – it is hard to imagine U. of Florida is breaking even at this rate (and that is before proposed cuts in indirect rates). But the university is fostering great research that has both immediate impacts (helping citrus growers) and long-term discoveries (detecting wildlife with wisps of DNA in the ocean) while also training students and postdocs as part of its educational mission. And this sort of contribution is common for the thousands of universities across the US.\nSo, TL;DR: any university is likely losing money on research in general; given the high variance in how much funding different research groups bring in, it is likely that nearly all individual labs are overall subsidized by the university (the “Use AI to find people who are bad credit risks” or the “Patent a banana that stays yellow for months” labs might be exceptions). Many people, even from “successful” labs (based on grants), are not bringing in enough funding to break even, but they are worth the investment due to their discoveries. Our institutions at a high level realize that the research is what matters and focus on that. For those of us who are even closer to the research, in the same departments as those doing the work, we should similarly value the quality of the work, not the money or other tools used to help achieve it. We must put in structural changes to reassure our junior colleagues that we will evaluate their work, not their funding, especially now.\n\nTo subscribe, go to https://brianomeara.info/blog.xml in an RSS reader.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{o'meara2025,\n  author = {O’Meara, Brian},\n  title = {Funding for Tenure},\n  date = {2025-05-04},\n  url = {https://brianomeara.info/posts/fundingfortenure/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nO’Meara, Brian. 2025. “Funding for Tenure.” May 4, 2025. https://brianomeara.info/posts/fundingfortenure/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you want to estimate the uncertainty in parameter estimates, including potential correlation issues between parameters, you can use our new package dentist (Boyko and O’Meara, 2024). It can take a function that computes a likelihood and explore parameters around it to get uncertainty, including varying by multiple parameters at once to help detect ridges.\nIf you don’t know why you want this, read on.\n\n\n\nFigure 3b from the dentist paper, showing the focal region in black, maximum likelihood estimate in red, and other sampled points too far from the optimum in gray\n\n\nThere are many R functions that use likelihood to fit models (OUwie, geiger, corHMM, phytools, and many more), which are often compared with measures like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Jeremy Beaulieu and I (among many others) have long pushed for for people to focus on parameter estimates rather than just which model fits best. An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model with two optima might fit better than a model with one, but while it is statistically supported it might not be biologically very relevant if the optima are close and the tip values range much more widely due to a low pull parameter. If different species range in size from 2 to 30 mm, two optima of 5 and 7 mm rather than one of 6 mm might not matter much in practice.\nBut even when people report parameter estimates, they often don’t report uncertainty in those estimates. This is deeply weird. We’re used to seeing “42 (CI 37-52) mm” or “42 ± 9 mm” but in comparative methods, people will only report “42 mm” (or, more commonly, “42” since we often omit units, too?!).\nA major reason for this is lack of tools. Some software does not calculate uncertainty at all. Some does, but only using an approximation of curvature at the peak itself (methods using the Hessian). Others do it with a Bayesian approach, which has some advantages, but requires setting a prior, and which can hide ridges in the likelihood surface if the prior is uniform, lognormal, normal, exponential, or anything else that is not perfectly flat for all values.\nDentist is a new approach. It has something of the feel of MCMC, but rather than traversing a surface of likelihood times prior, it explores a “dented” likelihood surface to find the contour with points far enough from the optimum to represent a confidence interval. Imagine a likelihood surface is a mountain peak; we dent it so that it looks like a crater, and we try to find the rim. We have algorithms to do this with different kinds of moves if needed.\nWhen it is done, the user gets not only the best parameter estimate but also a visualization of the confidence region around this space and a table with the parameter bounds. They can thus see ridges, as well as get a good estimate based on looking at the actual surface rather than just an estimate at the discovered peak.\nFor more details on why to use it, how to use it, and how it can fail, please see the paper.\nIt was a joy working with James Boyko on this. He was essential for pushing it forward, testing methods, writing, and so much more.\nOur paper has the usual boilerplate about thanking the reviewers and associate editor (Natalie Cooper). But in this case it is genuine. The paper, and method, improved through peer review (most essentially by encouraging us to let the threshold be set based on the number of parameters rather than left entirely up to the users, but in other ways, too, including pushing us to compare more directly with other approaches). There are lots of issues with peer review (biases in the reviews, unpaid expert efforts for obscenely profitable companies, delays in publication, impact selection, and more) but it really can help sometimes, as it did here.\nAnd finally, thank you to the US National Science Foundation (grant DEB-1916539) and the Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship, a Schmidt Futures programme.\n\nTo subscribe, go to https://brianomeara.info/blog.xml in an RSS reader.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{o'meara2024,\n  author = {O’Meara, Brian},\n  title = {Dentist for Likelihood},\n  date = {2024-02-29},\n  url = {https://brianomeara.info/posts/dentist/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nO’Meara, Brian. 2024. “Dentist for Likelihood.” February\n29, 2024. https://brianomeara.info/posts/dentist/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our department has long had a core class: one semester on ecology, one on evolution. It originated before I started here (it was somewhat modeled on UC Davis Population Biology’s core class, which I took as a student, in fact), but I’ve taught parts of it (usually a few weeks on phylogenetics and macroevolution) nearly every year I’ve been here. This year, I took over as the instructor for the evolution semester. Years ago the course was largely team taught with perhaps four or five instructors per semester; over time, this has winnowed down. I chose to do it as the sole instructor, with one guest discussion with Dr. Nina Fefferman on getting grants (she’s very good at it), as the students wanted to have a discussion on this.\nThis course is described as “Readings, lectures, and discussion about key concepts in evolution.” In practice, it has several goals:\nCourse structure was based on particular topics, with students typically given a paper or two to read and ask questions about, then work through the topic and questions in class (lots of think-pair-share, class questions, etc.). Students asked for more structure, so I started adding basic slides to give broader overviews of the topics and giving sample final exam questions for each topic so they could better understand the type of depth of knowledge I was expecting them to get.\nOften this sort of course covers a lot of history of the field, famous scientists, and the like. I focused instead on current understandings of the topics. This aligns with the course description (“key concepts in evolution”) but I argue that it’s more important for students who are doing their own research: what do we know, and what is still left to learn, rather than who thought what in 1968. That said, there is still vocab people should know in the field, including names of people and organisms, as well as local info (faculty members, Scopes trial, and similar), so I made a list of jargon (.csv), see also Section 4, and had some multiple choice quizzes and part of the final to encourage students to learn about these terms."

My goal was to have students get a bit of exposure and get over initial fear: they’re not going to be writing packages after a week, but they’ll know some of how this all works, that error messages are normal, how to get help, how to start using R and python, etc.\n\n3.1 R\nI made an exercise at https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizR, focused on this Rmarkdown file (https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizR/blob/main/main.Rmd) for students to download; we worked through it in class. You can see it rendered fully here as a pdf.

I thought showing them how to do machine learning could be useful, including having them viscerally feel the issues that could come from image classification. For a sample problem, since I had shown them a local salamander in the R tutorial, and they were interested, I suggested solving a problem of using machine learning to assess whether a sampled individual was a juvenile or adult (Notophthalmus viridescens, the Eastern Newt) – sort of an “awesome, I can see how this could scale up for my research” inspiration. Thus, I made this exercise (https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizPython), especially this sample script (https://github.com/bomeara/geewhizPython/blob/main/salamander.py).

    "title": "Williams College stops seeking federal grants",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Jeffrey Mervis in Science is reporting that Williams College is declining federal science grants. According to the article:\n\nSchool officials told the faculty Williams won’t accept new grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH) until the agencies clarify new language requiring grantee institutions to certify they aren’t doing anything to “promote or advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) … in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.”\n\nand\n\nThe provost’s email to faculty also cites a new initiative from the U.S. Department of Justice that allows private citizens to file a complaint against institutions receiving federal funds that they believe are violating federal civil rights laws. Refusing federal grants might decrease the risk that Williams could be sued, the email notes.\n\nWilliams College is a small liberal arts college with a high graduation rate, good ratio of tenure stream faculty to students, and an increasing ratio of applicants to available positions (see here). Their faculty, staff, and students publish hundreds of academic works per year. They have a robust endowment. Williams has taken steps to control expenses while focusing on priorities. All this is just to say that, from a poorly informed external perspective (mine), they seem to do be doing well overall – while there is concern about a lot of small liberal arts colleges, Williams is likely not in that set.\nSo one question I had was what the potential impact of declining grants could be on a college like this. Looking up grants at NSF and NIH, Williams College was listed as getting nine NSF grants worth $2M in 2024 and nine NSF grants worth $1.8M in 2023; it had no NIH grants in 2024 and one worth $435K in 2023. Based on its budget guide, its F&A rate (the negotiated amount that mostly covers the cost of infrastructure, personnel, and similar to support the research) is 50.8%. So, if we take its two year average of NSF and NIH funding, it could expect $2.1M in grants per year, of which about $1.4M is direct costs and $713K is indirect costs (the exact numbers are hard to calculate as not all direct costs are subject to the F&A rate).\nThis can pay for a lot of research, and so its loss will have a real impact on Williams College, and on everyone else who would benefit from the discoveries that would have been made. Federal funding is a zero sum game (if things work well) so the grant money Williams will not get will hopefully flow somewhere else, but Williams stepping back from competing means the pool of ideas to fund is impoverished, the same as any competition if a set of people are excluded from it.\nThe policy of declining funding has to be weighed against the risks associated with that funding, but some of those risks are unknown – for example, what are the potential risks from a private citizen complaint, and what is the probability of those risks? One federal sanction applied to a different college has been to prohibit international student enrollment (as of today, June 7, 2025, that has been temporarily put on hold, but the final resolution is not certain). International students often pay full tuition, so their loss would be a significant financial hit; that could be less true at Williams since it gives substantial aid to many international students, but it would still be costly (quick calculation: 2,146 undergrads, 9% are international, 30% of international pay full tuition = $4.2M in tuition just from these ~58 students, far more than the grant funding loss). Other potential risks include changing taxes on endowments or pressure to remove accreditation. Maybe forgoing federal research funding reduces these risks, though there still are requirements that come with things like federal funding for students that Williams still accepts (a few colleges, like Hillsdale College, choose not to accept federal funds and thus are not subject to Title IV and some other regulations).\nThis policy also reduces the risk of wasted effort on grant proposals. According to the proposed NSF budget (see Summary Tables page 5), the success rate for grants will drop from 26% to 7%. That suggests that, if Williams College proposals have the same success rate as the average (likely wrong due to variation across programs and areas, but wrong in an unclear direction), faculty would have written 35 proposals to get their nine funded ones in 2024, but next budget year would have to write 129 to get nine funded ones. Presumably scaling up writing this much wouldn’t be feasible: if instead they put in as many proposals as likely in the past, they could only expect 2-3 grants under the proposed budget. So the prohibition on receiving funding from proposals (and presumably not writing them) means a loss of 2-3 grants rather than 9 (if the proposed budget becomes the de facto one that NSF spends), but also saves the effort of writing 14 proposals for each one that happens to get funded.\nOne other effect is on tenure expectations. Williams’ new policy makes it less likely to fire early career faculty for not getting major grants (in a tough climate to win funding) since the institution prohibits getting those grants for now (see another post by me on this).\nThese are all rough numbers based on readily available external information only – I’m not part of the Williams community to know all the factors at play, and I have no special insight into what is happening and could happen at the federal level. I also could have just made simple errors (such as missing a whole set of grants in the NSF data).\nOverall, I’m not sure if the Williams College policy is a good one or not. It is more likely to be good if it came from a shared governance process so that a lot of smart, concerned people who would be affected by it helped craft it. But my first response to questions like this is to run numbers and analyses, and try to consider all the potential pros and cons, so I’m putting the rough analysis here in case others find parts of it useful.\n\nTo subscribe, go to https://brianomeara.info/blog.xml in an RSS reader.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{o'meara2025,\n  author = {O’Meara, Brian},\n  title = {Williams {College} Stops Seeking Federal Grants},\n  date = {2025-06-07},\n  url = {https://brianomeara.info/posts/williamsgrants/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nO’Meara, Brian. 2025. “Williams College Stops Seeking Federal\nGrants.” June 7, 2025. https://brianomeara.info/posts/williamsgrants/."

    "text": "Last year, one of my kids was a junior starting to look at colleges. Picking a college is a big deal; when I get stressed, I like data: my security blanket is a big matrix. There are sites that allow you to compare colleges, but they often use weird metrics (how do provosts rate other colleges), don’t often have a nice table for comparison (turns out some of them put public data behind a paywall, too), and omit some important information (are the instructors used in the student-to-instructor ratio tenure track faculty (who have stability in their jobs) or more contingent faculty who might have to scramble to make ends meet semester to semester?). So I decided to gather data: initially I just wanted to get a table, but then thought, well, it woudn’t be that much harder to put it online, and then… it snowballed into the current site at https://collegetables.info/ with 13,424 pages (including one page for every college and every major).

    "text": "3 Main data\nThe US National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has an Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) that has info on postsecondary schools: schools that students enroll in after high school. It includes colleges and universities, seminaries, trade schools, and more. They have one dataset per year stored as a Microsoft Access database which turned out to be hard to convert (and I didn’t want to buy MS Access). They also have individual data files per year. Here is a subset of files from 2022:\n\nFiles are in csv; there is also a data dictionary file in Excel with more info on what each column and states within it means: for example, that “LOCALE” in table “HD2022” means “Locale codes identify the geographic status of a school on an urban continuum ranging from large city to rural” and that code 12 means “City: Midsize”, 31 means “Town, Fringe”, etc.\nTo get the files, I first made a list of all the file name types (admissions data are in ADM2021, ADM2020, etc.): function GetIPEDSNames() stores this (functions without a package:: prefix are ones written for the workflow; links go to the function source) – it stores the abbreviations in a vector, with better descriptions of the files as names of the vector.\nI then try to get the data files for each year, download them, and do some basic processing using GetIPEDSDirectly(). Each file is in a zipped directory (which may include multiple files, for example if there is both the original file and a later revised one). I also download the data dictionary. The correct file is loaded (using readr::read_csv unless the file is too large, when I use arrow::read_csv_arrow), the data dictionary is loaded with readxl::read_excel, and then the data dictionary is used to give columns and entries more informative names. These are all then saved as csv files in a local directory.\nThis is the ipeds_directly step in the highlighted workflow below.\n\nI then use AggregateDirectIPEDSDirect() to load all the files and store them in an SQLite database (yes, I probably should have just paid for Microsoft Access and gotten the original files in this format).\nThe next step is creating a massive table (comparison_table_core): one row per institution per year with only the columns I might care about. It’s 86798 rows by 890 columns, using 669.9 MB of memory. One very nice feature of IPEDS data is each institution having a unique UNITID, allowing stitching together of data from different tables and even sometimes different sources. Things like institution names can be duplicated, but the UNITID is unique.\nThe above steps are the main difficult ones, and I’m omitting various details (handling errors in the datasets, odd formats, etc.). But we have the main data! Info on majors and fields is similar."

Things like access to health care procedures, gun regulations, and more are changing and may change into the future. Other things of interest are whether a college is in a desert or forest, how far it is from mountains (one of my kids was interested), and even life expectancy (hopefully not relevant to undergrads, but for people choosing to build a career at an institution, this might be useful info). A lot of info is aggregated at state level (like Erin Reed’s risk of anti-trans legislation map or the Guttmacher Institute’s abortion access map), making adding this to the massive table easy; other data like biome or distance to mountains could be per location. A series of functions append info on these various factors to the main table.\nI have my own views on which factors and in which directions are important, but I wanted to make the site neutral: someone can filter for colleges in states with high or low proportion of US reps who vote in favor of protecting access to contraception, for example, with no default ordering put in place by me.\ngmbaR was essential in the distances to mountains calculation.\nThere are other sources of information I would like to include on social climate (even down to the campus level), but many do not allow reuse of their data, and I wanted to respect their wishes."

    "section": "5 Individual pages",
    "text": "5 Individual pages\nParametric rmarkdown is used for institution pages. Rmarkdown was developed by Yihui Xie and builds on from work by John Gruber (markdown) and John McFarlane (pandoc). Rmarkdown lets you write in text with easy to read formatting and insert blocks of code that can be run when compiling the document. Parametric rmarkdown lets you pass arguments into the document: you could have a template of a report and have it pass in company info: “Over the past quarter stocks in company_name have changed by percent_change, but this is not a guarantee of future stock motion.” You can also have it embed plots or tables. Quarto is in some ways a successor to rmarkdown (I use it for my personal website), but when I was developing collegetables quarto was new enough that I encountered some issues.\nFor each institution page, I use the template _institution.Rmd. Its header includes the following parameters:\nparams:\n  institution_name: \"nothing\"\n  institution_long_name: \"nothing\"\n  institution_id: \"nothing\"\n  comparison_table: \"nothing\"\n  spark_width: 200\n  spark_height: 60\n  weatherspark: \"nothing\"\n  index_table: \"index_table\"\n  life_expectancy: \"nothing\"\n  population_by_state_by_age: \"nothing\"\nAnd then within the body of the template it includes text and some functions to compute info for tables and plots as well as to pass in notes. For example, if the focal institution’s enrollment is decreasing over time, a note is prepended to the output document. Not all notes are bad, but they are things that people might want to look into.\nThen the RenderSingleInstitutionPage() function does a basic loop to pass in information to create the page for each institution. Each page has lots of graphs, as well as embedded things like some javascript libraries. To save on space, I use the self_contained: false argument in the header YAML: that way all the files are not embedded in each page. I also make the graphs as separate files to load (though I might have javascript render them on the fly in the future: I wasn’t satisfied with the information density of the graphs available in javascript when I was first doing them). Alt tags for each image are also generated within the rmarkdown file for improved accessibility.\nGetting the initial data is done infrequently; changing the institution pages is more frequent as I tweak something or as one of the state-level datasets changes. So much of the time is spent on re-rendering the institution pages. I now have it in targets do this as a map so if it stops halfway through, it can pick up with the next institution rather than restarting:\n tar_target(\n    pages_new, \n    RenderSingleInstitutionPage(institution_unitid, comparison_table, fields_and_majors, maxcount=maxcount, CIPS_codes=CIPS_codes, weatherspark=weatherspark, yml=yml, index_table=index_table, life_expectancy=life_expectancy, population_by_state_by_age=population_by_state_by_age, institution_rmd=institution_rmd),\n    pattern=map(institution_unitid)\n ),"

They can then dig further down into degrees by majors (https://collegetables.info/majors_Doctorate_Astronomy.html). I’ve thought of using a treemap or other way to visualize the categories, but it’s hard because the basic level of fields has 48 large categories and 2321 fields within those. This area is probably not as useful for undergrads (who might not know their major in fine detail yet) but could be good for grad students looking to specialize (i.e., “where can I get a Masters in forestry?”: https://collegetables.info/majors_Masters_Forestry_General.html, though don’t forget the separate degree of urban forestry)."

    "section": "9 Learning",
    "text": "9 Learning\nI work in higher ed, so I thought I knew a fair bit about the higher ed landscape going in. However, a few things surprised me:\n\n“Traditional” isn’t: Our conventional view of college is it’s a four-year experience in fancy buildings, students live in dorms, tenured faculty walk the halls. Harvard, Berkeley, and the like. But a huge proportion of undergrad degrees are coming from places like Western Governors University, which has 108,000 undergrads, three times as many as UC Berkeley. Yet one of the trade publications for higher education, the Chronicle of Higher Education, mentions “Western Governors University” 362 times, Berkeley 6,442 times, and the even smaller Harvard 14,735 times. Undergraduate enrollment isn’t the only component of higher education: research and other creative activities, service to the community (including public scholarship, ag outreach, and more), commercial spinoffs, graduate education, and more are all important and often are a focus at the more famous schools. But even in discussion of undergrad education, schools affecting lots of students remain not a major focus. (Also, “a four-year experience” is often a lie: the graduation rates commonly reported are six-year graduation rates, and many, many students take longer than the nominal four years for a bachelors degree. Families, look at the four- and six-year grad rates before yelling at your students for taking too long).\nIgnore sticker price: Listed tuitions aren’t what many people pay, and traditional knowledge of what schools are “cheap” versus “expensive” are often wrong. For example, what’s cheaper, U. of Oklahoma or Princeton? For a family making $30K-48K a year getting federal aid, the average cost of Oklahoma is $16,097 but for Princeton it’s $4,502. There are all sorts of things that affect cost (including state aid, institutional aid, loans versus grants, and more), but the sticker price is not a good guide. To help make people think about this, I added a comparison to “expensive” Harvard to every institution page.\nRise in disabilities: for example, at Yale the percentage of students with disabilities went from 6% in 2015 to 22% in 2021. Others have reported on this, but it really jumped out of the data.\nLack of information on mental health resources: mental health matters a lot in college. What’s the ratio of therapists to students? What’s the wait time to get an appointment? Is there a cap on sessions? I could not find data on this.\nDisappearance of books: many universities seem to be shrinking libraries. Physical circulation is also decreasing, while digital increases. For example, here’s the data for U. of Alabama:\n\n\nIt still has a lot of books, and the number has become stable, but there was a longer term decrease in their collections size. The use of physical collections is decreasing (I divide by the number of faculty and students to get an estimate normalized by university size): on average, every student or faculty member there seems to check out less than one physical thing a year. * There are many small schools. For example, there are many schools for hair styling. The beauty of parametric rmarkdown is that including these takes no extra work, and it might help somebody."

My younger kid is only a freshman in high school, so still has some time. I’ll keep poking at the site, though.\nI’d love to get more data on life at the colleges: how involved are students in club activities, are fraternities or sororities a big part of campus culture, etc. Mental health resources would also be good. There are data on crimes, but we know underreporting is a huge problem: I worry that the schools that look “worst” for some crimes might be the ones that actually have earned the trust of survivors to report."

    "text": "Note you can see a feed of recent articles at Google Scholar; this updates more quickly than this page does. In the lag time between submission and publication, you can see my manuscripts on bioRxiv.\n\nTrait evolution\nWork in our lab most usually focuses on trait evolution, with most emphasis on methods that allow heterogeneity over the tree. For example, O’Meara et al. (2006) developed a method that allows the rate of Brownian motion to vary over a tree. This can be used to test ideas about rate evolution (Collar et al. 2009; Collar et al. 2010) and has been cited 150 times (according to Google Scholar in Aug. 2012). This work has been extended to deal with shifting rates, strengths of attraction, and means under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (Beaulieu et al. 2012). Similarly, we have developed a model for different rates of gene loss on different parts of a tree (O’Meara 2007) and methods for looking at hidden rates for discrete characters (Beaulieu et al. 2014). A review of methods in general has been published (O’Meara 2012b) where I tried to show connections across methods. We have also looked at empirical datasets, often plants, to understand evolutionary processes (eg., Zanne et al. 2013, Williams et al. 2014, Cornwell et al. 2014).\n\n\nSpecies delimitation / gene tree-species tree messiness\nThe fact that gene trees and containing species trees has become increasingly apparent through work by many researchers. While this is often seen as a problem, our lab used information from gene tree-species tree conflict to estimate species boundaries and a species tree simultaneously, without requiring a priori specification of potential groups (O’Meara 2010). Ongoing work in collaboration with Bryan Carstens has resulted in a draft program to broaden this approach to phylogeography.\n\n\nPhylogenetic inference\nTo do something useful with a phylogeny first requires getting the phylogeny, perhaps with dates. Various publications have come from inferring trees (Driskell et al. 2004; Abercrombie et al. 2011), developing new implementations for dating trees (Smith and O’Meara 2012), and defending the need for trees (Smith and O’Meara 2009).\n\n\nSoftware\nThe point of what we do is to foster new discoveries about biology, especially about macroevolutionary processes. Availability of methods seems to be rate-limiting in many cases: once a new method appears, a flurry of empirical activity uses it to test long-standing hypotheses or infer new patterns. For this to happen, methods have to be available in software. Our work with iPlant (Goff et al. 2011) has aimed to make comparative methods more scalable and accessible, through the iPlant discovery environment and through our recent work on the rPlant interface to iPlant tools. Work in R in general has become a recent trend, ranging from porting existing code to R (Stack et al. 2011) to maintaining a task view of all R packages that deal with phylogenetics (O’Meara 2012a). See the software page for more.\n\n\nSelected publications\nAbercrombie, J. M., B. C. O’Meara, A. R. Moffatt, and J. H. Williams. 2011.

    "text": "Sexual harassment\nSee the University description here. Briefly, unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment if it is a condition of employment or status in a course, program or activity; when submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for employment, grades, etc.; when conduct substantially interferes with an individual’s work performance, academic performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Note that this means that it is possible (that is, it could constitute harassment, not that such behavior is allowed) for a peer to harass a peer or even a supervisor by creating a toxic environment. Harassment is a non-trivial risk in science (i.e., Clancy et al. 2014 ), it is not the victim’s fault, and it should be reported to the Office of Equity and Diversity, dean of students, dept. head or dean, or human resources (and this is not only me saying this, but also what the University recommends). I am a mandated reporter for Title IX violations, as are grad students in their teaching roles; mandated reporters must report any issues to the Title IX Coordinator or her deputies, who are far more experienced in these issues than we are. Links at the top of the page have information about police, counseling, emergency medical care, and other important resources. Many conferences are adopting policies about more general harassment, as well: see this one from Mozilla Science for an example. Even if no such policy exists, sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes or images should be avoided: be professional, and help make the field better."

UT has guidelines for what to do if there is an active shooter situation. Review it before there is an actual emergency. To let family and friends know you are ok during an emergency (of any kind) you can go to https://reconnect.utk.edu; Facebook also will make a place to register if a situation affects enough people.

For example, I have helped look at postdocs’ papers, given suggestions, but this correctly did not result in them adding me as an author. There are gray areas: does giving someone an idea that their work is then based upon constitute authorship? What about supplying an essential script? The key approach to use is transparency and discussion: at the start of a project, discuss authorship (author order as well as who may be an author at all), and check back in after significant work (simulations done, writing done, etc.). Being an author on a paper is the currency of science; some families do not like discussing currency, but it is essential in keeping the lab working well. In case of conflicts, feel free to have me get involved to help mediate."

I also want to do good science with you while you are here, of course. One thing you should not do is pass up a better opportunity for your career. It’ll be a bit of a pain for me if you leave your postdoc after six months for a tenure track job at your dream institution (have to search for another candidate, it may be the wrong season, etc.) but I still think you should do it. Good positions are rare enough that you should jump at good opportunities. It is also best for the lab long term: I’d rather have a good colleague for years in the future than someone sad for another year or two of work because she or he missed a great opportunity. This should all be obvious, but I have heard of situations where postdocs are strongly encouraged to stay despite their best interests lying elsewhere."

    "text": "Computer use\nComputers (including laptops you use on and off campus) are University property (assuming you have a lab one, not one with your personal funds), and there is a policy document here. It is worth reading in its entirety, but some key highlights:\n\n“There should be no expectation of privacy for any information stored, processed, or transmitted on university IT resources.”\n“email may be a public record and open to public inspection under the Tennessee Public Records Act, unless the email is covered by an exception to the Act, such as personally identifiable student information, proprietary information, or trade secrets.”\n“Users will not… Commit copyright infringement, including file sharing of video, audio, or data without permission from the copyright owner.” Many universities have ways of detecting the streaming of pirated content; I do not know if such mechanisms exist here, but you don’t want to risk having your internet cut off or even being fired over this.\n“[U]sers are prohibited from using these resources for personal gain, illegal activities, or obscene activities.” This includes things like using a cluster for mining bitcoin or other virtual currencies (which has happened elsewhere). Even if the cluster is not full, this causes wear on the drives, increased power consumption, and other direct harm.\n\nWithin the lab we sometimes use APIs or get content by repeated queries to websites (for example, with Encyclopedia of Life’s permission we wrote a script to download each of their millions of pages). Talk to me before doing something like this: sometimes this is against the terms of use of a website (it can appear like a denial of service attack, in fact) and can have real consequences. For example, Rod Page’s entire university lost access to Google Scholar due to a free resource he created to find scientific papers related to a species’ name; I know of a postdoc who lost access to GenBank after using NCBI’s API at the wrong time of day and without enough of a pause between calls. It can happen accidentally, as well: the Rentrez R package can query Entrez for information without violating the rate limits, but if you were to do this in parallel on just two cores, you could violate these limits. There are legitimate use cases for scraping and other ways of doing these things, but just check in with me first. To maintain lab computers I may have sudo access; this means that in theory I could look through your emails, etc. I will not (subject to extreme exceptions like a court order); if you have similar admin access to other computers, I expect the same. However, do remember that IT can in theory access all information stored on our computers, and some things like university emails are subject to Freedom of Information Act requests."

    "text": "Social media\nSocial media are an important way to communicate with friends, family, professional colleagues, and the broader public. Remember that with the digital era, capturing information is easy, erasing it is hard. A candid photo you send to a friend with an app that claims to delete the photo a few seconds later, for example, might be deleted, but could be preserved as a screen shot on a phone, only to reappear before a job interview. Websites are hacked frequently, privacy policies are changed with little notice, etc. so you should operate under the assumption that anything you post or comment on may be world-viewable at some point. Even anonymity can break down (it is “security through obscurity”): see, for example, this exposure of an “anonymous” twitter user by an editor at a major journal. My personal approach to this is to make my public social media persona just about science and related issues (reducing barriers for members of underrepresented groups, open source code, etc.) and keep more personal views about politics, religion, developmental milestones of relatives locked down. That is just one approach; a different approach is publicly share info about all your activities and views. Both are fine; just make sure that if you want to post something that if it “gets out” at some point in the future would cause problems you carefully evaluate the benefits and risks. You would probably not want your tweet about “I pity people who have to work in the state of XYZ” to come up a couple of years later at your job interview at University of XYZ, for example."

Take extra care with snow; even if you know how to drive on ice and your vehicle can handle it, the pickup truck sliding sideways towards you might not. The University may close; if it doesn’t, but you are scheduled to teach, note the inclement weather policy. Strong thunderstorms and even tornados happen with some frequency (we had a car totaled and a roof severely damaged by tornado-associated hail soon after moving here). There are various weather apps to give you alerts. It is worth noting the distinction between a tornado watch and a tornado warning. A watch means conditions are favorable for tornados: they could form, but haven’t been seen yet. Even if there isn’t a tornado, though, high wind and hail can be real hazards. A tornado warning means a tornado is imminent or occurring. You should follow advice from the National Weather Service. To give you a sense of what I do, for a tornado watch (at home), I make sure our shelter is clear, that we have flashlights and charged cell phones, and I then watch the weather. When there’s a tornado warning for our area, we all go into an interior closet on the first floor of the house."

    "text": "Office Hours: https://tiny.utk.edu/EEB464OfficeHours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructor: Dr. Brian C. O’Meara\nOffice hours: 11-12 M and by appointment: 446 Hesler\nMeeting time: 10:10-11:00, MWF, Buehler 476\nDescription:\nThe course is a lecture format course with classroom discussion and participation. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts in macroevolution including current areas of debate (drivers of evolutionary rates, modes of speciation, etc.) and taught to think critically. Computer-based exercises, especially simulations, will allow students to learn how processes acting on short to medium time scales affect long term patterns. 3 credits\nTo understand macroevolution, it is important to learn about who, what, where, when, how, and why.\n\nWho: Organisms\nWhat: Non-living context (rocks from space, environmental conditions) Where: Biogeography (on Pangaea or Bermuda?)\nWhen: Geological time scale\nHow: Pattern of evolution\nWhy: Process of evolution\n\nThe course will cover all these areas. The ones that are most interesting, of course, are the how and especially the why. These are also the best to cover in class, where there can be discussion and other interaction. Rote learning (word meanings and the like) is something that you should be able to do on your own at this point in your education, with occasional guidance. We’re not going to use much class time on this, but you will have to learn this info. I will clearly describe what you do have to learn (and if it’s not clear, ASK), and quizzes and tests will be ways to evaluate your progress and provide further incentive to learn.\n\n\n\nExplain and provide examples of each the five big ideas in Biology, using their knowledge of biological concepts gained from their course of study:\n\nEvolution: Populations of organisms and their cellular components have changed over time through both selective and non-selective evolutionary processes. This is the main point of the course, and will be covered in every lecture and activity.\nStructure and Function: All living systems (organisms, ecosystems, etc.) are made of structural components whose arrangement determines the function of the systems. This will be highlighted especially in the discussions of morphological evolution (flight, insects, etc.)\nInformation Flow and Storage: Information (DNA, for example) and signals are used and exchanged within and among organisms to direct their functioning. Origin of life will cover this extensively.\nTransformations of Energy and Matter: All living things acquire, use, and release and cycle matter and energy for cellular / organismal functioning. The discussion of escalation focuses on this, and it comes up in background on the focal organisms.\nSystems: Living systems are interconnected, and they interact and influence each other on multiple levels. Speciation, extinction, discussion, and history of life all cover this.\n\nDemonstrate the ability to perform the following scientific practices:\n\nFormulate empirically-testable hypotheses. This is the point of the final presentation.\nInterpret visual representations (figures and diagrams). These will come up throughout the class, especially in the context of phylogenetic trees.\nEvaluate data and come to a conclusion (with evidence) (formulate an argument). Much of class discussion emphasizes this skill: I’ll present information and have you elaborate on this and provide potential explanations.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nFormulate, defend, and critically evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms\nUnderstand the context and reason for evolutionary patterns\nInterpret information from fossils, phylogenies, and other data sources\nGenerate ideas for feasible, compelling scientific projects\n\nTo really understand evolution and converse with other scientists, you have to know the names of some groups (imagine trying to talk about the history of some musical genre without knowing the names of any musicians or songs in that genre). Thus, most days, you will be responsible for learning about a particular taxon (on the syllabus, below). This could be a single species or a clade of many species. You should learn very basic info: what is it, what is it related to (i.e., where it attaches to the tree of life we will grow over the class), why it is important to know. For example: “Angiosperms: all flowering plants, lots of species, became common in the Cretaceous but may have originated earlier, sister to Gnetales.” Working together on the website forum to get this info is encouraged (you can decide to rotate the job, let whoever gets the info first post it, etc.). What I really care about is that you learn it. Note that some of the taxa may be subsets of the other taxa (elephants are a kind of vertebrate).\nWriting and presentations will be graded on a variety of levels, such as grammar, structure, and substance. The purpose of grading and comments is to improve your writing. Remember that your writing is being graded, not you.\nWord count sets a minimum length (and references are not counted) but you may go a bit longer if needed (try to keep below 125% of required length). Since length is judged by words, not page length, please don’t do any odd formatting of your paper (huge or tiny margins, font sizes of 8 or 18, etc.) to try to meet some page limits.\nPapers/midterms will be turned in via the course website (Canvas). This eliminates issues with printers, odd file formats, and the like. The site will automatically check your work for possible plagiarism. I do this in all my classes with written work. Except where noted, assignments are to be done individually. You must cite and reference work properly. When in doubt about citation, plagiarism, or collaboration, ASK.\nFor help with submitting documents online, see https://online.utk.edu/students/assignment.shtml. There is a practice uploading assignment that will allow you to test to make sure you can upload files correctly before the pressure of a deadline. If there is a problem at the moment of a deadline, email me your work instead to verify it is done on time (but normally you should be using Canvas).\nCommunication is very important. I have set up a forum on the Canvas site for our course. If you post a question there, I will immediately be emailed about it and will respond on the forum (though perhaps not immediately). Emailing me directly will not be any faster (though do email me if the issue is better addressed one-on-one). The benefit of using the forum is that everyone can see the answers and there’s a chance that one of the other students will answer the question first. Feel free to use the forum for other class-related discussions.\nThough we have the main Canvas site, and notices will come through there, I will also be posting things (like slides) to https://brianomeara.info/eeb464. Why a second site? The Canvas site is only active during the course and only to students enrolled in the course. You might want to look at the materials in other semesters, show your friends/family what you were learning, etc., so I have the public site that will persist.\nAttendance is expected at all classes, though missing a class or two due to illness, family problem, etc. might happen. You can communicate with the Office of the Dean of Students (https://dos.utk.edu/absence-notifications/) if you want to document absences (and this can be easier for you than doing it separately in each of your classes). Rarely, school is also canceled due to snow.\nImportantly, the Dean of Students Office can also offer you help – the usual reasons students are absent are not happy ones, and they may be able to point you to useful resources. One great resource in general is the 974-HELP line (865-974-4357: https://dos.utk.edu/974-help/our-approach/) if you are worried about yourself or any other student, please call that line. Other options available from https://dos.utk.edu/, https://titleix.utk.edu/, and https://bias.utk.edu/ include ways to set up a meeting with a dean, report sexual misconduct, report bias-based incidents, or deal with other issues. I am of course happy to try to help as well.\nWe will have discussions in nearly all classes. You should participate in them. Sometimes, discussions in a class such as this consist of students trying to return the right answer to the instructor’s question. To avoid this, sometimes I pursue a policy of not talking during a discussion for several minutes or longer so you have to talk to each other. This can result in complete silence. If you find this annoying, talk! Even if there is not a formal discussion, please ask questions at any point during class. Please be respectful of others in class discussions. A good discussion often features students talking with each other rather than just directing comments at me. When referring to others, be careful not to use the wrong pronoun for them: I personally go by he/him, but clearly that does not work for everyone (and please let me know what pronouns work best for you). In discussions, it can also be worth separating ideas from the people thinking them: “I don’t think that’s how speciation works” can lead to a more fluid discussion than, “You’re wrong about speciation.”\nTake notes. Any slides are an object to help you learn, but not the sole content: this is not a class where each slide is dense with bullet points, and as long as you can write them down on a test later, you get a good grade. There may be a slide with just a dinosaur on it and we talk for ten minutes about it: how did we know what it ate, what questions are still unresolved, etc. There are no written words on the slide, but still things you should learn from this discussion. So take notes during each class and look over them when you get home. On the final, you will be able to have a single sheet of paper with information – you can think about what should be on that paper, and revise as you go. For taking notes, a study (Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014, https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581) suggests that you learn more taking notes by hand, on paper. That can be especially handy in this class, where we may use diagrams to illustrate concepts. I do not mandate taking notes by hand, as it does not work for everyone – if you want to take notes using a computer or other device, that is fine – but do try taking notes by hand if it might work for you. You may also record the class; I only ask that you respect your classmates’ privacy (people are learning, they should be getting things wrong and taking the risk of giving incorrect answers: I do not want people to be afraid of what they say being misused later).\nLate work is penalized at 10%/day (so something turned in 49 hours late is given a score 70% of what it would have received on the due date). Extensions are not normally granted. Remember that even if you turn something in seven days late, it is still worth more points than not turning it in at all (and the grading for the class is just #points received / #points available, so something getting 20/100 points is still worth twice something getting 10/100 points, even though they are both an “F” individually).\nMy goal is to have you learn. If you are having trouble with something in the course, or if there is a topic you just have to learn more about, let me know (email, office hours, online forum, etc.). Faculty often use evaluations at the end of the semester to get info from students so we can improve before the next class, but this does not help you directly. To allow the class to improve while you are taking it, I have created a site for anonymous feedback at https://brianomeara.info/feedback.html (and yes, it is really anonymous). Let me know things that are going well or poorly — both are important. I might not implement all your suggestions, but they will all be read and considered, generally the same day you submit them.\nPlease contact Student Disability Services (https://sds.utk.edu/) if you may need an appropriate accommodation plan.\nI never went to office hours as a student. That was a bad idea. Office hours are ways for you to talk to instructors about topics in the course or related issues – if you want to talk to me about applying to grad school, or labs you can do research in here, or a cool paper you read, come to office hours!\nAll relevant University policies (including, but not limited to, policies on academic integrity, attendance, etc.) apply to this course. In the case of any conflict between the policies in this syllabus and University policy, University policy applies. The instructor reserves the right to revise, alter, and/or amend this syllabus as necessary. Students will be notified by email of any such revisions, alterations, and/or amendments.\n\n\n\n\n100 points: Topic review. 1000 words, including references. Cover a macroevolutionary question: what is known about it, what is the state of work on it, what work might be done in the future? Work should be individual.\n100 points: Pair presentation. Imagine you are trying to get money to study a macroevolutionary question. You have to make a compelling case to a potential funder (i.e., the NSF will give you $15K to study it, or a professor might offer you a place in her lab to work on this). You should include 1) why that question is interesting (this should include what is known about it), 2) how you plan to address it, 3) what potential outcomes of your work may be, and 4) the implications of these. 10 minute talk (PowerPoint, Keynote, PDF, etc.). Be sure to include references in your slides.\n50 points: Class work. This includes quizzes, activities, and other in class assignments. In general, these will not be announced in advance. Note that 80 points will actually be assigned but the maximum score possible will be 50 points. The goal of this is to allow you to miss some classes without needing to bring a note justifying your absence.\n100 points each: Take home midterms. You may NOT work with classmates or other humans, but you can use notes, books, papers, etc. (though do not plagiarize them, not that the questions will be ones you can typically plagiarize).\n200 points: Final exam. Similar to the midterm, but with a bit more evaluation of rote knowledge.\n\nIn addition to these assignments, students will periodically be given articles to read for later discussion.

O’Meara\nOffice hrs: 11-12 M and by appointment; 446 Hesler\nMeeting time: 10:10-11:00 MWF, 412 Buehler\nDescription:\nThe course is a lecture format course with classroom discussion and participation. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts in macroevolution including current areas of debate (drivers of evolutionary rates, modes of speciation, etc.) and taught to think critically. Computer-based exercises, especially simulations, will allow students to learn how processes acting on short to medium time scales affect long term patterns. 3 credits\nTo understand macroevolution, it is important to learn about who, what, where, when, how, and why.\nWho: Organisms\nWhat: Non-living context (rocks from space, environmental conditions)\nWhere: Biogeography (on Pangaea or Bermuda?)\nWhen: Geological time scale\nHow: Pattern of evolution\nWhy: Process of evolution\nThe course will cover all these areas. The ones that are most interesting, of course, are the how and especially the why. These are also the best to cover in class, where there can be discussion and other interaction. Rote learning (word meanings and the like) is something that you should be able to do on your own at this point in your education, with occasional guidance. We’re not going to use much class time on this, but you will have to learn this info. I will clearly describe what you do have to learn (and if it’s not clear, ASK), and quizzes and tests will be ways to evaluate your progress and provide further incentive to learn.\nBiology program learning objectives:\nI include how this course addresses these in italics.\nExplain and provide examples of each the five big ideas in Biology, using their knowledge of biological concepts gained from their course of study:\n\nEvolution: Populations of organisms and their cellular components have changed over time through both selective and non-selective evolutionary processes. This is the main point of the course, and will be covered in every lecture and activity.\nStructure and Function: All living systems (organisms, ecosystems, etc.) are made of structural components whose arrangement determines the function of the systems. This will be highlighted especially in the discussions of morphological evolution (flight, insects, etc.)\nInformation Flow and Storage: Information (DNA, for example) and signals are used and exchanged within and among organisms to direct their functioning. Origin of life will cover this extensively.\nTransformations of Energy and Matter: All living things acquire, use, and release and cycle matter and energy for cellular / organismal functioning. The discussion of escalation focuses on this, and it comes up in background on the focal organisms.\nSystems: Living systems are interconnected, and they interact and influence each other on multiple levels. Speciation, extinction, discussion, and history of life all cover this.\n\nDemonstrate the ability to perform the following scientific practices:\n\nFormulate empirically-testable hypotheses. This is the point of the final presentation.\nInterpret visual representations (figures and diagrams). These will come up throughout the class, especially in the context of phylogenetic trees.\nEvaluate data and come to a conclusion (with evidence) (formulate an argument). Much of class discussion emphasizes this skill: I’ll present information and have you elaborate on this and provide potential explanations.\n\nCourse learning objectives:\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nFormulate, defend, and critically evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms\nUnderstand the context and reason for evolutionary patterns\nInterpret information from fossils, phylogenies, and other data sources\nGenerate ideas for feasible, compelling scientific projects\n\nTo really understand evolution and converse with other scientists, you have to know the names of some groups (imagine trying to talk about the history of some musical genre without knowing the names of any musicians or songs in that genre). Thus, most days, you will be responsible for learning about a particular taxon (on the syllabus, below). This could be a single species or a clade of many species. You should learn very basic info: what is it, what is it related to (i.e., where it attaches to the tree of life we will grow over the class), why it is important to know. For example: “Angiosperms: all flowering plants, lots of species, became common in the Cretaceous but may have originated earlier, sister to Gnetales.” Working together on the website forum to get this info is encouraged (you can decide to rotate the job, let whoever gets the info first post it, etc.). What I really care about is that you learn it. Note that some of the taxa may be subsets of the other taxa (elephants are a kind of vertebrate).\nWriting and presentations will be graded on a variety of levels, such as grammar, structure, and substance. The purpose of grading and comments is to improve your writing. Remember that your writing is being graded, not you.\nWord count sets a minimum length (and references are not counted) but you may go a bit longer if needed (try to keep below 125% of required length). Since length is judged by words, not page length, please don’t do any odd formatting of your paper (huge or tiny margins, font sizes of 8 or 18, etc.) to try to meet some page limits.\nPapers/midterms will be turned in via the course website (Canvas). This eliminates issues with printers, odd file formats, and the like. The site will automatically check your work for possible plagiarism. I do this in all my classes with written work. Except where noted, assignments are to be done individually. You must cite and reference work properly. When in doubt about citation, plagiarism, or collaboration, ASK. Please turn in work as plain text or RDF. This makes it easier for me to put them in one document so I can give you back grades with comments.\nFor help with submitting documents online, see https://online.utk.edu/students/assignment.shtml. There is a practice uploading assignment that will allow you to test to make sure you can upload files correctly before the pressure of a deadline. If there is a problem at the moment of a deadline, email me your work instead to verify it is done on time (but normally you should be using Canvas).\nCommunication is very important. I have set up a forum on the Canvas site for our course. If you post a question there, I will immediately be emailed about it and will respond on the forum (though perhaps not immediately). Emailing me directly will not be any faster (though do email me if the issue is better addressed one-on-one). The benefit of using the forum is that everyone can see the answers and there’s a chance that one of the other students will answer the question first. Feel free to use the forum for other class-related discussions.\nThough we have the main Canvas site, and notices will come through there, I will also be posting things (like slides) to https://brianomeara.info/category/macroevolution/ . Why a second site? The Canvas site is only active during the course and only to students enrolled in the course. You might want to look at the materials in other semesters, show your friends/family what you were learning, etc., so I have the public site that will persist.\nAttendance is expected at all classes, though missing a class or two due to illness, family problem, etc. might happen (and is strongly suggested in the case of flu: https://studenthealth.utk.edu/common_avoidflu.php )\nWe will have discussions in nearly all classes. You should participate in them. Sometimes, discussions in a class such as this consist of students trying to return the right answer to the instructor’s question. To avoid this, sometimes I pursue a policy of not talking during a discussion for several minutes or longer so you have to talk to each other. This can result in complete silence. If you find this annoying, talk! Even if there is not a formal discussion, please ask questions at any point during class.\nLate work is penalized at 10%/day (so something turned in 49 hours late is given a score 70% of what it would have received on the due date). Extensions are not normally granted, except under extraordinary circumstances (having too much work to do does not qualify, for example). Remember that even if you turn something in seven days late, it is still worth more points than not turning it in at all (and the grading for the class is just #points received / #points available, so something getting 20/100 points is still worth twice something getting 10/100 points, even though they are both an “F” individually).\nMy goal is to have you learn. If you are having trouble with something in the course, or if there is a topic you just have to learn more about, let me know (email, office hours, online forum, etc.). Faculty often use evaluations at the end of the semester to get info from students so we can improve before the next class, but this does not help you directly. To allow the class to improve while you are taking it, I have created a site for anonymous feedback at https://brianomeara.info/teaching/feedback/ (and yes, it is really anonymous). Let me know things that are going well or poorly — both are important. I might not implement all your suggestions, but they will all be read and considered, generally the same day you submit them.\nAny student who feels s/he may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss specific needs. Please contact the Office of Disability Services at 865-974-6087 in Dunford Hall to coordinate reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.\nAll relevant University policies (including, but not limited to, policies on academic integrity, attendance, etc.) apply to this course. In the case of any conflict between the policies in this syllabus and University policy, University policy applies. The instructor reserves the right to revise, alter, and/or amend this syllabus as necessary. Students will be notified by email of any such revisions, alterations, and/or amendments.\n\nGrading:\n100 points: Topic review. 1000 words, including references. Cover a macroevolutionary question: what is known about it, what is the state of work on it, what work might be done in the future? Work should be individual.\n100 points: Pair presentation. Imagine you are trying to get money to study a macroevolutionary question. You have to make a compelling case to a potential funder (i.e., the NSF will give you $15K to study it, or a professor might offer you a place in her lab to work on this). You should include 1) why that question is interesting (this should include what is known about it), 2) how you plan to address it, 3) what potential outcomes of your work may be, and 4) the implications of these. 10 minute talk (PowerPoint, Keynote, PDF, etc.). Be sure to include references in your slides.\n50 points: Class work. This includes quizzes, activities, and other in class assignments. In general, these will not be announced in advance. Note that 80 points will actually be assigned but the maximum score possible will be 50 points. The goal of this is to allow you to miss some classes (due to illness, death in the family, or other such reasons) without needing to bring a note justifying your absence.\n100 points each: Take home midterms. You may NOT work with classmates or other humans, but you can use notes, books, papers, etc. (though do not plagiarize them, not that the questions will be ones you can typically plagiarize).\n200 points: Final exam. Similar to the midterm, but with a bit more evaluation of rote knowledge.\nIn addition to these assignments, students will periodically be given articles to read for later discussion. Quizzes or other assignments will assess whether the articles have been read.\nFinal letter grades will be assigned at the end of the semester using an instructor-specified scale. I aim for grading consistency across years and with other courses at UTK.\n\n\n\nFluttershy teaching about phylogenetics\n\n\n\n\nHere are all the presentations.

There is a practice uploading assignment that will allow you to test to make sure you can upload files correctly before the pressure of a deadline. If there is a problem at the moment of a deadline, email me your work instead to verify it is done on time (but normally you should be using Canvas).\nCommunication is very important. I have set up a forum on the Canvas site for our course. If you post a question there, I will immediately be emailed about it and will respond on the forum (though perhaps not immediately). Emailing me directly will not be any faster (though do email me if the issue is better addressed one-on-one). The benefit of using the forum is that everyone can see the answers and there’s a chance that one of the other students will answer the question first. Feel free to use the forum for other class-related discussions.\nThough we have the main Canvas site, and notices will come through there, I will also be posting things (like slides) to https://brianomeara.info/eeb464. Why a second site? The Canvas site is only active during the course and only to students enrolled in the course. You might want to look at the materials in other semesters, show your friends/family what you were learning, etc., so I have the public site that will persist.\nAttendance is expected at all classes, though missing a class or two due to illness, family problem, etc. might happen. You can communicate with the Office of the Dean of Students (https://dos.utk.edu/absence-notifications/) if you want to document absences (and this can be easier for you than doing it separately in each of your classes). Rarely, school is also canceled due to snow.\nImportantly, the Dean of Students Office can also offer you help – the usual reasons students are absent are not happy ones, and they may be able to point you to useful resources. One great resource in general is the 974-HELP line (865-974-4357: https://dos.utk.edu/974-help/our-approach/) if you are worried about yourself or any other student, please call that line. Other options available from https://dos.utk.edu/, https://titleix.utk.edu/, and https://bias.utk.edu/ include ways to set up a meeting with a dean, report sexual misconduct, report bias-based incidents, or deal with other issues. I am of course happy to try to help as well.\nWe will have discussions in nearly all classes. You should participate in them. Sometimes, discussions in a class such as this consist of students trying to return the right answer to the instructor’s question. To avoid this, sometimes I pursue a policy of not talking during a discussion for several minutes or longer so you have to talk to each other. This can result in complete silence. If you find this annoying, talk! Even if there is not a formal discussion, please ask questions at any point during class. Please be respectful of others in class discussions. A good discussion often features students talking with each other rather than just directing comments at me. When referring to others, be careful not to use the wrong pronoun for them: I personally go by he/him, but clearly that does not work for everyone (and please let me know what pronouns work best for you). In discussions, it can also be worth separating ideas from the people thinking them: “I don’t think that’s how speciation works” can lead to a more fluid discussion than, “You’re wrong about speciation.”\nTake notes. Any slides are an object to help you learn, but not the sole content: this is not a class where each slide is dense with bullet points, and as long as you can write them down on a test later, you get a good grade. There may be a slide with just a dinosaur on it and we talk for ten minutes about it: how did we know what it ate, what questions are still unresolved, etc. There are no written words on the slide, but still things you should learn from this discussion. So take notes during each class and look over them when you get home. On the final, you will be able to have a single sheet of paper with information – you can think about what should be on that paper, and revise as you go. For taking notes, a study (Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014, https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581) suggests that you learn more taking notes by hand, on paper. That can be especially handy in this class, where we may use diagrams to illustrate concepts. I do not mandate taking notes by hand, as it does not work for everyone – if you want to take notes using a computer or other device, that is fine – but do try taking notes by hand if it might work for you. You may also record the class; I only ask that you respect your classmates’ privacy (people are learning, they should be getting things wrong and taking the risk of giving incorrect answers: I do not want people to be afraid of what they say being misused later).\nLate work is penalized at 10%/day (so something turned in 49 hours late is given a score 70% of what it would have received on the due date). Extensions are not normally granted. Remember that even if you turn something in seven days late, it is still worth more points than not turning it in at all (and the grading for the class is just #points received / #points available, so something getting 20/100 points is still worth twice something getting 10/100 points, even though they are both an “F” individually).\nMy goal is to have you learn. If you are having trouble with something in the course, or if there is a topic you just have to learn more about, let me know (email, office hours, online forum, etc.). Faculty often use evaluations at the end of the semester to get info from students so we can improve before the next class, but this does not help you directly. To allow the class to improve while you are taking it, I have created a site for anonymous feedback at https://brianomeara.info/feedback.html (and yes, it is really anonymous). Let me know things that are going well or poorly — both are important. I might not implement all your suggestions, but they will all be read and considered, generally the same day you submit them.\nPlease contact Student Disability Services (https://sds.utk.edu/) if you may need an appropriate accommodation plan.\nI never went to office hours as a student. That was a bad idea. Office hours are ways for you to talk to instructors about topics in the course or related issues – if you want to talk to me about applying to grad school, or labs you can do research in here, or a cool paper you read, come to office hours!\nAll relevant University policies (including, but not limited to, policies on academic integrity, attendance, etc.) apply to this course. In the case of any conflict between the policies in this syllabus and University policy, University policy applies. The instructor reserves the right to revise, alter, and/or amend this syllabus as necessary. Students will be notified by email of any such revisions, alterations, and/or amendments.\n\n\n\n\n100 points: Topic review. 1000 words, including references. Cover a macroevolutionary question: what is known about it, what is the state of work on it, what work might be done in the future? Work should be individual.\n100 points: Pair presentation. Imagine you are trying to get money to study a macroevolutionary question. You have to make a compelling case to a potential funder (i.e., the NSF will give you $15K to study it, or a professor might offer you a place in her lab to work on this). You should include 1) why that question is interesting (this should include what is known about it), 2) how you plan to address it, 3) what potential outcomes of your work may be, and 4) the implications of these. 10 minute talk (PowerPoint, Keynote, PDF, etc.). Be sure to include references in your slides.\n50 points: Class work. This includes quizzes, activities, and other in class assignments. In general, these will not be announced in advance. Note that 80 points will actually be assigned but the maximum score possible will be 50 points. The goal of this is to allow you to miss some classes without needing to bring a note justifying your absence.\n100 points each: Take home midterms. You may NOT work with classmates or other humans, but you can use notes, books, papers, etc. (though do not plagiarize them, not that the questions will be ones you can typically plagiarize).\n200 points: Final exam. Similar to the midterm, but with a bit more evaluation of rote knowledge.\n\nIn addition to these assignments, students will periodically be given articles to read for later discussion. Quizzes or other assignments will assess whether the articles have been read (and will be part of the class work grade).\nFinal letter grades will be assigned at the end of the semester using an instructor-specified scale. I aim for grading consistency across years and with other courses at UTK.

O’Meara\nOffice hrs: 11-12 M and by appointment; 446 Hesler\nMeeting time: 10:10-11:00 MWF, 412 Buehler\nDescription:\nThe course is a lecture format course with classroom discussion and participation. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts in macroevolution including current areas of debate (drivers of evolutionary rates, modes of speciation, etc.) and taught to think critically. Computer-based exercises, especially simulations, will allow students to learn how processes acting on short to medium time scales affect long term patterns. 3 credits\nTo understand macroevolution, it is important to learn about who, what, where, when, how, and why.\nWho: Organisms\nWhat: Non-living context (rocks from space, environmental conditions)\nWhere: Biogeography (on Pangaea or Bermuda?)\nWhen: Geological time scale\nHow: Pattern of evolution\nWhy: Process of evolution\nThe course will cover all these areas. The ones that are most interesting, of course, are the how and especially the why. These are also the best to cover in class, where there can be discussion and other interaction. Rote learning (word meanings and the like) is something that you should be able to do on your own at this point in your education, with occasional guidance. We’re not going to use much class time on this, but you will have to learn this info. I will clearly describe what you do have to learn (and if it’s not clear, ASK), and quizzes and tests will be ways to evaluate your progress and provide further incentive to learn.\nBiology program learning objectives:\nI include how this course addresses these in italics.\nExplain and provide examples of each the five big ideas in Biology, using their knowledge of biological concepts gained from their course of study:\n\nEvolution: Populations of organisms and their cellular components have changed over time through both selective and non-selective evolutionary processes. This is the main point of the course, and will be covered in every lecture and activity.\nStructure and Function: All living systems (organisms, ecosystems, etc.) are made of structural components whose arrangement determines the function of the systems. This will be highlighted especially in the discussions of morphological evolution (flight, insects, etc.)\nInformation Flow and Storage: Information (DNA, for example) and signals are used and exchanged within and among organisms to direct their functioning. Origin of life will cover this extensively.\nTransformations of Energy and Matter: All living things acquire, use, and release and cycle matter and energy for cellular / organismal functioning. The discussion of escalation focuses on this, and it comes up in background on the focal organisms.\nSystems: Living systems are interconnected, and they interact and influence each other on multiple levels. Speciation, extinction, discussion, and history of life all cover this.\n\nDemonstrate the ability to perform the following scientific practices:\n\nFormulate empirically-testable hypotheses. This is the point of the final presentation.\nInterpret visual representations (figures and diagrams). These will come up throughout the class, especially in the context of phylogenetic trees.\nEvaluate data and come to a conclusion (with evidence) (formulate an argument). Much of class discussion emphasizes this skill: I’ll present information and have you elaborate on this and provide potential explanations.\n\nCourse learning objectives:\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nFormulate, defend, and critically evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms\nUnderstand the context and reason for evolutionary patterns\nInterpret information from fossils, phylogenies, and other data sources\nGenerate ideas for feasible, compelling scientific projects\n\nTo really understand evolution and converse with other scientists, you have to know the names of some groups (imagine trying to talk about the history of some musical genre without knowing the names of any musicians or songs in that genre). Thus, most days, you will be responsible for learning about a particular taxon (on the syllabus, below). This could be a single species or a clade of many species. You should learn very basic info: what is it, what is it related to (i.e., where it attaches to the tree of life we will grow over the class), why it is important to know. For example: “Angiosperms: all flowering plants, lots of species, became common in the Cretaceous but may have originated earlier, sister to Gnetales.” Working together on the website forum to get this info is encouraged (you can decide to rotate the job, let whoever gets the info first post it, etc.). What I really care about is that you learn it. Note that some of the taxa may be subsets of the other taxa (elephants are a kind of vertebrate).\nWriting and presentations will be graded on a variety of levels, such as grammar, structure, and substance. The purpose of grading and comments is to improve your writing. Remember that your writing is being graded, not you.\nWord count sets a minimum length (and references are not counted) but you may go a bit longer if needed (try to keep below 125% of required length). Since length is judged by words, not page length, please don’t do any odd formatting of your paper (huge or tiny margins, font sizes of 8 or 18, etc.) to try to meet some page limits.\nPapers/midterms will be turned in via the course website (Canvas). This eliminates issues with printers, odd file formats, and the like. The site will automatically check your work for possible plagiarism. I do this in all my classes with written work. Except where noted, assignments are to be done individually. You must cite and reference work properly. When in doubt about citation, plagiarism, or collaboration, ASK. Please turn in work as plain text or RDF. This makes it easier for me to put them in one document so I can give you back grades with comments.\nFor help with submitting documents online, see https://online.utk.edu/students/assignment.shtml. There is a practice uploading assignment that will allow you to test to make sure you can upload files correctly before the pressure of a deadline. If there is a problem at the moment of a deadline, email me your work instead to verify it is done on time (but normally you should be using Canvas).\nCommunication is very important.

My CV highlighting products only created since my tenure packet went in (the work that is the main focus on the promotion decision is in black text, the earlier work (summer 2014 and earlier) is in gray) is here. This attempt for promotion was successful, and as of August 1, 2019, I am now a full professor at the U of Tennessee, Knoxville.\nNote in 2019: This is kept online in case it helps others going up for promotion to have a template. Remember the bias we often have when looking at things like this: many of us tend to focus on the things where we’re “not as good” as the template, but ignore the many cases where we are actually “better.” I’m not sure that this particular document will create such feelings, but know that it’s likely I’d feel the same reading your packet.\nPromotion packet PDF\nCV showing differences since tenure PDF"

    "text": "Key papers\nA welcome and increasing trend is for folks to read intensely a few papers to get a sense of a scientist, rather than (or in addition to) looking at count, impact factor of the journals published in, etc. For those doing this, these are good papers:\n\nO’Meara, Smith, et. al. 2016 [equal first authors]. This has some interesting methods in it, but I think the key importance of the paper is its focus on nonequilibrium dynamics and interactions between traits: it took tens of millions of years for angiosperms to evolve the key floral trait combinations that led to fast diversification. https://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1830/20152304\nBeaulieu and O’Meara 2016. This paper describes a new method for looking at traits leading to diversification that also allows for unexamined traits to have some or all of the effect. The importance of this paper is the focus on using models to help learn new things about organisms, rather than just rejecting trivial nulls: “Surprise is a necessary part of discovery that, to put it bluntly, has been relatively lacking in trait-dependent diversification studies until now. With HiSSE we can still test our intuitions about a particular character, but we can also discover that rates seem to be driven by some unknown and unmeasured character state, allowing the data to help us generate new hypotheses”  https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/65/4/583/1753616\nJackson, Morales, Carstens, and O’Meara, 2017. This describes software for examining multiple phylogeographic hypotheses. Most current approaches focus on a testing a few key hypotheses, or have constraints such as not allowing gene flow between diverging populations. This approach lets biologists examine a wide variety of hypotheses about possible histories of connections and subdivision between populations (later work extends this for species delimitation with gene flow).  https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syx001"

There used to be millions of bison on the plains: now there are around 20,000 (plus ones in commercial herds), not enough wild individuals to fill a fifth of the seats of our local football stadium. Passenger pigeons have gone from flocks taking days to pass overhead to extinction. There is scientific evidence for a massive decline of insects (plus the anecdotal evidence – how many insects have you had to clean off the front of your car, or how many have you seen circling the porch lights lately?). American chestnuts have gone from a population of billions to functional extinction.\nGiven all this, it’s amazing that there are still creatures whose survival strategy is abundance: fill every hungry mouth, and the excess survive and reproduce. Periodical cicadas emerge at a location every 13 or 17 years (depends on the species) in tremendous numbers. We had one brood in Eastern Tennessee last year, and the brood this year is starting to emerge.\nIt’s still early, but you can defintely hear them and if you look carefully, see them (follow the sound; then look for ones flying near the tops of trees; then look more closely at the places where they land; eventually you will get a good search image. Later in the year they’ll be extremely obvious in the places they live). Here’s a zoomed in picture from yesterday of several on a branch (look for bits peeking out behind leaves):\n\nAnd the surprising thing is how accessible they are. These are on a bike path next to Calhoun’s in Oak Ridge, TN – I found them from the sound of their calling, over the sound of a podcast in a closed car. Here’s the tree with them now, so folks in Oak Ridge can find them (walk on the greenway from the rowing association towards Calhoun’s, look at the tops of the two trees on the right just after you cross the bridge close to the restaurant):\n\nAnd a map showing their location:\n\nIt is still early in the emergence – I hope for more as the season progresses. These were still pretty high up in the trees; last year they were lower and more accessible in a slightly different location (broods can overlap somewhat).\nOne approach to finding them near you is to use iNaturalist, which has a map of periodical cicadas from this year:\n\nCicada Safari has more info on periodical cicadas.\n\nTo subscribe, go to https://brianomeara.info/blog.xml in an RSS reader.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{o'meara2025,\n  author = {O’Meara, Brian},\n  title = {Periodical Cicadas},\n  date = {2025-05-18},\n  url = {https://brianomeara.info/posts/cicadas/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nO’Meara, Brian. 2025. “Periodical Cicadas.” May 18, 2025.\nhttps://brianomeara.info/posts/cicadas/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Social media keeps changing. I stopped using Facebook years ago (I still have an account, as my kids’ schools and some scientific orgs use it for communication, but I’m not active). I stopped using Twitter in November, 2022, though still keep an account to avoid impersonation (though people could find better accounts to impersonate). I’m now using this blog, but it’s unidirectional – you can read it or not, but I deliberately don’t have any way for people to comment.\nI’m increasingly active on Mastodon, and various scientific societies and colleagues are now active there, too. Here’s an overview.\nIt’s probably easiest to think of Mastodon as\n\nSimilar to an email account: are you example@gmail.com or example@harvard.edu, but now it’s @example@mastodon.social or @example@sauropods.win. People on one provider (“instance” in Mastodon jargon) can generally see information from people on others, unless one of them has put a block on it (in the same way that your email provider may block emails from certain spammy domains).\nBut set up so that by default you can see what everyone on your instance posts.\n\n\nIt is not a 1:1 Twitter replacement\n\nYou can search for hashtags but not post content otherwise (people sometimes make sites to allow full search, but this is apparently against the norms and there’s pushback)\nThe algorithm is based on recency only. That is an algorithm, of course – it says people who are active at the same time you are should be prioritized. And it’s better than many other algorithms in social media (“prioritize things that make people angry”, “prioritize posts by the owner”, “prioritize people with the wealth to pay for it”, etc.). But I’d love to see something that prioritizes users I engage with the most even if they have different sleep schedules.\nYou can “like” or “boost”. Like tells the poster you like something – it does nothing for ranking that or later posts, for you or for others. Boost sends the post to all of your followers and onto your general instance feed.\nThere is no quote-tweeting. You can reply, or you can write a new post that has a link to the old, but the whole “wrap another post with your commentary” doesn’t exist (yet). This is seen as a way by those influencial in Mastodon as a way to prevent bullying, but taking a screen shot of a post is still possible.\nPosts can be edited, easily.\nThere is a strong culture of including alternative text on images so that those who cannot see the images well know what they are. This is a good thing; do it.\nDue to how the instances are organized, they can block one another (“defederate”), just as your email provider could block all emails from a certain domain. This can be a way of blocking from instances that don’t have good moderation.\nAnyone can set up an instance; it’s easier than setting up an email provider. However, it’s a lot of responsibility: moderating is HARD.\nYou can change your instance easily. It’s like moving from hotmail to gmail: you can move your contacts (people you follow), but your posts won’t follow.\nModeration is up to each instance (similar to reddit subreddits). Some do a good job, others do not. And sometimes people may disagree on what moves are important to them. For example, there was a debate a few months ago about defederating from a journalism instance: a user posted a very bad article from a major US newspaper on the instance: should other instances block this whole instance (which has journalists from many media sources) since they allow this sort of post, or should it still be allowed to communicate? The person administrating your server decides (though you may still block individual people on your own).\nIt still lacks some features important for safety: see this thread, for example. Twitter was not perfect, either, and media reports that it is getting even worse, but this does not mean that Mastodon is doing everything right.\n\n\n\nWhich instance to join?\n\nOne of the biggest, and the one run by the main developer, is mastodon.social. It has (as of the date of this post) about 212,000 users. It is a general instance. It’s the one I’m currently on: https://mastodon.social/@omearabrian . I like it because I use social media to attempt to have reach. It’s also likely stable – it won’t go down if a check bounces or if an admin loses interest. However, see if its moderation works for you. For social media, moderation is a big deal, and it can cover things like hate speech but also things like tone-policing; ignoring vs confronting racism, sexism, homophobia; whether bots are allowed; and more.\nA lot of people and journals in my academic sphere are on https://ecoevo.social/about, which is moderated by Dr. Alexis Simon. It has 1,900 users, including groups like https://ecoevo.social/@SystBiol, https://ecoevo.social/@ASNAmNat, https://ecoevo.social/@sse_evolution, and https://ecoevo.social/@evol_mtg. It’s also a reasonable place to start.\nThere’s an instance for bots: https://botsin.space/about. I haven’t set up anything there yet, but stay tuned.\nThere are a lot of other instances. You can find info at https://joinmastodon.org/servers. Don’t overthink it: at this point, it’s like choosing between gmail and yahoo for email. There is a difference, but not as big a difference as between having email and not having email.\n\n\n\nHow to find people?\n\nSearching for hashtags is good. You can get a tweetdeck-like interface by going to Preferences -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Enable advanced web interface and turning it on; then you can have columns dedicated to particular hashtags. See who is posting interesting stuff.\nYou can see who other people are following. I’m following these people (note that following does not mean endorsement or agreement, just that I want to hear what they say).\n\n\n\nHow to use?\n\nThere are dedicated apps (some free, some paid). I mostly just use the web instance.\n\n\n\nAutomate all the things\nThough I’m on mastodon.social, many in my community are on ecoevo.social. So I wanted to follow them all. Here’s R code to do that, using rtoot:\nSchoch David and Chan Chung-hong (2023) rtoot: Collecting and analyzing Mastodon data. R package version 0.3.0, https://github.com/schochastics/rtoot.\nNote that I assume this is all ok, and I have a pause to keep from overwhelming anything, but 1) you will be rate-limited at some point and will have to restart after waiting a bit (but it’ll only follow new people, so you won’t start from scratch), and 2) mass-following could be a scammy thing to do (i.e., someone could mass-follow everyone on a huge instance to try to game getting more followers). I like following ecoevo.social people because mastodon.social’s feed is huge and has lots of things not that interesting to me, while ecoeco.social (and a smaller instance, sauropods.win) does have a lot of interesting users, so I want to follow them. It also hopefully encourages new users: “someone want to hear what you say!”\nlibrary(rtoot)\n\ninstance_name &lt;- 'ecoevo.social'\n\nmy_following &lt;- read.csv(\"~/Downloads/following_accounts.csv\")\n\nuser_count &lt;- get_instance_general(instance_name)$stats$user_count\nnumber_of_calls &lt;- min(ceiling(user_count/40),4000)\nfor (i in sequence(number_of_calls)) {\n  people &lt;- get_instance_directory(instance_name,offset=40*(i-1), limit=40, local=TRUE, order=\"new\")\n  for (user in people$username) {\n    full_user &lt;- paste0(user, '@', instance_name)\n    print(full_user)\n    if(full_user %in% my_following$Account.address) {\n      print(\"Already following, not going to add\")\n    } else {\n      system(paste0('toot follow ', user, '@', instance_name), timeout=30)\n    }\n    Sys.sleep(10)\n  }\n}\n\nTo subscribe, go to https://brianomeara.info/blog.xml in an RSS reader.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{o'meara2023,\n  author = {O’Meara, Brian},\n  title = {Joining {Mastodon}},\n  date = {2023-04-30},\n  url = {https://brianomeara.info/posts/joiningmastodon/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nO’Meara, Brian. 2023. “Joining Mastodon.” April 30, 2023.\nhttps://brianomeara.info/posts/joiningmastodon/."

    "title": "An alternative to CRAN for phylogenetics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For installing R packages, CRAN is the main place to go. It’s a fantastic free service that checks R packages to make sure they meet standards and then compiles them for multiple architectures. It’s largely a volunteer effort and is important to keep packages working together. Bioconductor is a more specialized repository. Getting a package to pass the checks to go on CRAN has long been a point of pride, and it does lead to higher quality packages, though with odd constraints (the overall package size must be small, all examples must run very quickly, and more).\nHowever, keeping a package on CRAN is an issue. Requirements keep changing: will this package work on the development version of R on Debian with a clang compiler, Fedora with a gcc compiler, Mac with both arm and x86 chips, Windows, etc. and continue to do so as operating systems, hardware, and compilers change? For example, our hisse package was removed briefly from CRAN in spring 2023 (it’s back online) because of an issue where, while the package passed all checks for Mac, Windows, Linux, all R-devel, R-patched, R-release, and R-oldrel, it would generate a warning if compiled using the -Wlto-type-mismatch flag to GCC. Our code hadn’t changed, and this wouldn’t have affected any users, but CRAN gave us two weeks to fix the warning. We didn’t do it on time, so it was archived, which does affect users (making it impossible for most users on Mac or Windows to use it, for example, as they don’t have compilers installed).\nIf you are part of an ecosystem, there are further risks. Many phylogenetics packages depend or import geiger – CRAN removed that package, and then two weeks later would have also archived every package that depends on it. Geiger’s authors got it restored in time, but it shows how brittle CRAN’s policies make our community. It’s like the Randall Munroe XKCD cartoon:\n\nbut with the poor maintainer in Nebraska putting the whole ecosystem at risk if they take two weeks off and there is a new requirement in the interim.\nThe nature of academia makes this even more precarious. A student might work on a package for their dissertation and others could find it very useful. There is no guarantee that the student remains in the field: it’s not unusual for someone to go into teaching, or working at a nonprofit, or working for a company, and even the weak incentive of getting more citations is no longer sufficiently relevant for them to volunteer their time to meet changing CRAN standards. Ongoing maintenance would be ideal for the field, but it is a high bar.\nFortunately, rOpenSci has made an alternative: r-universe. This creates a place where R packages can be built automatically for different platforms, just as CRAN does, but in nearly real time. If a package is in an open source repository (the best known is GitHub), and the r-universe instance knows about it, it will try to compile it. Thus, even if something goes off CRAN, students taking a class can likely still install it from r-universe.\nTo help our community, I’ve created an instance for phylogenetics. The instance is at https://phylotastic.r-universe.dev/ . Information on how to use it is at http://phylotastic.org/phylotastic.r-universe.dev/. For the packages, I’ve used everything from the CRAN task view for phylogenetics (something I maintained for over a decade, now taken over by Dr. William Gearty who has assembled a team to keep it going), as well as other packages used in phylogenetics in R, including packages in development.\n\nUsing the universe\nTo use the most recent available version of each package:\noptions(repos = c(\n  phylotastic = 'https://phylotastic.r-universe.dev',\n  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org')\n )\nThis will check the phylotastic r-universe, and only go to CRAN for packages that are not there.\nTo use the CRAN package if available, then use phylotastic as a backup:\noptions(repos = c(\n  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org',\n  phylotastic = 'https://phylotastic.r-universe.dev')\n )\n\n\nWhy “phylotastic”?\nPhylotastic started as an idea launched at the [US] National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, NESCent, in 2012. Over hackathons and other events, and later an NSF grant (written by Arlin Stoltzfus, Enrico Pontelli, and me) it resulted in various tools for phylogenetics (includng http://datelife.opentreeoflife.org/ ). I wanted to keep that connection, not least so that people could use phylotastic R packages even when there are CRAN hiccups.\n\nTo subscribe, go to https://brianomeara.info/blog.xml in an RSS reader.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{o'meara2023,\n  author = {O’Meara, Brian},\n  title = {An Alternative to {CRAN} for Phylogenetics},\n  date = {2023-04-23},\n  url = {https://brianomeara.info/posts/phylotasticruniverse/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nO’Meara, Brian. 2023. “An Alternative to CRAN for\nPhylogenetics.” April 23, 2023. https://brianomeara.info/posts/phylotasticruniverse/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I saw a post on bluesky from the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society about a new paper by Dr. George Sangster on eponyms in birds: naming birds after people. This is an issue I’ve been curious about for some time, partly due to the related issue of naming awards after people (see here). Issues that come up in these areas are 1) should we name organisms after people who did awful things? 2) how extensive are the biases in who gets species named after them? 3) what are the effects of either of the above on recruiting and retainng people in the field? and 4) how will changes in naming practices, both moving forward and (more controversially) changing existing names affect the above three points? The paper represents a tremendous amount of careful work to address the second question, including an analysis of how the biases have changed over time.\nThe paper is well worth reading and contributes greatly to this discussion. However, I was a bit surprised by one of its conclusions:\n“Importantly, there is no need for drastic changes in naming practices, because the desired changes (greater representation of women and non-western people) are already taking place (and have been for several decades).”\nThe paper does identify trends in this direction, but I was curious about how long the changes would require. Dr. Sangster generously released the analyzed data as a supplemental file, so I downloaded it to run some analyses. It already had some linear regressions showing changes in representation since 1900; I threw the file into R to do similar analyses, but extrapolating to the future."

    "section": "1 Proportionality in new names",
    "text": "1 Proportionality in new names\nThe first question is how long with current trends it will take for a proportional fraction of the eponymous names to be named after people in the different groups. For gender, if we limit the population of potential namesakes to women and men only, and assume they are equal frequencies in the population, parity is at 50%. For Western vs non-Western, one standard would also be 50%; a better one might be to use proportion of the world population that is Western vs non-Western (though this has also changed over time). Using populations sizes from here, and adopting the definition of Western the paper seemed to use, 85.8% of people are non-Western.\nUsing these thresholds and linear regression, with a 95% confidence interval:\n\nYear when half of NEW eponyms are named for women: 2340 (2220, 2662)\nYear when half of NEW eponyms are named for non-Western people: 2101 (2070, 2156)\nYear when a proportional number of NEW eponyms are named for non-Western people: 2255 (2191, 2367)\n\nSo, it will take 315 years to have equal representation of women in new eponyms, and 230 years to have proportional representation of non-Western people, under the current yearly increase in representation in names taxonomists choose. This is about as far in the future as Linneaus was in the past. That’s a long time.\nBelow are some plots showing the extrapolations. Clearly, extrapolating out this far is silly: but the big point is that even with current trends it’s going to take a very, very long time."

One issue is that birds are a well-studied group: the number of new species being described is declining (though not an argument for lack of a need for more taxonomy):\n\nAn extrapolation into the future quickly results in having a negative number of newly described species in future years. I instead used a more optimistic assumption that the future will resemble the 10 year average of the most recent years in the dataset, so with 16.7 species described per year.\nWe can see how the number of species named after women, men, Westerners, and non-Westerners has changed over time up to the present:\n\nAnd then we can continue the trend into the future, incorporating the increasing proportion of species named for women and non-Western people but also the trend of a greater proportion of eponyms overall (which I was surprised to learn about in the original paper). I ran the model for a thousand years into the future:\n\nSo at least over the next thousand years, eponymous bird names will not reach parity with human population proportions for the groups analyzed in this paper."

    "title": "Uncertainty and risk",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As I write this (Jan 31, 2025), it is an odd time. The new US presidential administration cut off disbursement of most federal funds; a court order then stayed this, and the memo pausing disbursement was retracted, but there is still an argument as to whether funds may flow. Regardless, the National Science Foundation is still not disbursing funds, even to PRFB postdocs who rely on requested withdrawals to be paid (even requests from last week are not being processed). There is an “updated often” page from NSF that hasn’t changed in a couple of days. It’s not clear when or if funding will resume, nor what programs, if any, might be cut. Some colleges have told people to rein in expenditures, others just to limit expenditures that might violate an executive order, some have said change nothing in how funds should be used.\nIn the meantime, on social media there are many splashy advertisements to recruit students for NSF-sponsored research experiences for undergrads (REUs). These can be transformative: undergrads are supported over a summer to do new research they drive, often surrounded by strong mentoring and other support structures. If a student takes this, it replaces essentially a summer job or other internship.\nThis is also a time when grad recruiting is happening: some programs are flying students out for interviews and visits. In the sciences, generally students are both admitted to a program and offered a job as a teaching assistant or research assistant; the job pays tuition, offers healthcare, and gives a student a stipend. TAs are generally centrally funded: there must be people to run discussion sections or labs, and so departments get a certain number of lines to staff their classes. The funding for these will generally come out of university funds, a mixture of tuition and perhaps state support or endowment funds. RAs are generally funded by external grants (with some exceptions). If an RA dries up, a student might then be put on a TA line.\nThe uncertainty is what happens to REUs and RA lines in the future. It could be that everything reverts to how it was: it is a rigorous process to select what the government will fund (with the vast majority of proposals being rejected), using criteria that were passed into law and have been stable for many years, and so changing them, especially on already awarded funds, might not take place (and there are legal and prudential arguments for such an outcome). The other extreme is that all current NSF funding is cut, eliminating REUs and RAs entirely, and even existing TAs might be needed for current grad students on an RA. Or it could be something in between. There is nothing public that is definitive either way. And even if we had perfect knowledge of current plans, that is of only modest predictive value: maybe a lawsuit stops one intended outcome, maybe another Sputnik moment leads to an increase in funding. We just can’t know, and that may go on for a while.\n\nWhat we can do\nThere are lots of discussions about what various external actors should be doing with this; a thing we have control of is how we handle this uncertainty. A big part of that is deciding who inherits the risk and how the risk is communicated.\n\nBusiness as usual (high student risk, low university risk, max opportunities): For example, one approach is to assume things continue as before: anything with allocated or promised funding will continue to receive funds. Offers are made to an REU or grad school, likely with a small parenthetical statement on “(subject to availability of funds),” and students jump at the offered chance and get rid of their other options. This is optimal for the REU or grad program: if all goes well, great students sign up early, so the grant or the RA line is filled with strong candidates. If funds do go away, the students are out of a job and have to scramble, but the program itself is fine – no loss of money. This maximizes risk to students. It also incentivizes minimizing communication of risk so students feel safe signing up early. But students are in a very poor position to understand risk: if faculty and administrators don’t know what is going on, what chance does a sophomore applying to an REU or a senior applying for a grad program have?\nUniversity steps up (low student risk, high university risk, min opportunities): A different approach would be to have the university assume the risk. Make the offers, but if funding does not arrive, the university takes on the burden of supporting the students. This is a major risk to the university, but the university at least has better ways to assess risk (through connections to lobbyists, legislators, etc.) than a bunch of undergrads do. A university also likely has a much fatter savings account (endowment) than students, though often with contraints on how it can be spent. Besides the risk to the university, this does also lead to fewer opportunities: the university might be able to support only half the enrollment a grant would, so fewer students get an offer.\nMax transparency (low student risk, moderate university risk, moderate opportunities): An intermediate approach would be maximal communication. Be very up front about risks to funding and that, even if the program wants to admit them, students should keep a backup plan up to some reasonable date. One approach to this, borrowed from college athletics, could be letters of intent. “We intend to admit you to our REU / grad program with this offer, but cannot formally promise this until [some date].” Then, when funding is assured or the university is comfortable assuming the risk for the student, send a formal offer of admissions. The risk is that “good” students might go to a university adopting the first approach (“I have a letter of intent from you, but they gave me an offer [with an asterisk I missed], so I’m going there”); the benefit is that it’s possible that there are more students admitted than under approach two. It’s also less dishonest than the first approach (which does not exactly lie, but is far from forthcoming about possibilities).\n\nThis is likely to be a long period of uncertainty, with a lot of focus on what people can do to change things at national levels. But we do have (more) control on what we do within our own institutions. We will need to continually ask ourselves who we are helping, who we are putting at risk, and how we can be honest about this.

    "text": "People who are members of the Society of Systematic Biologists should check for an email with subject: “SSB Code of Ethics”. It contains a link to a ballot and more information.\n\nDear SSB Members,\nBased on 4+ years of intensive work by multiple ASN/SSB/SSE joint committees, SSB has developed a Code of Ethics and an accompanying Enforcement Policy. Here, we ask members to vote on amending the SSB Governance Documents (Constitution and Bylaws) to require members to adhere to this Code of Ethics, to empower the Council to establish and enforce this Code of Ethics, and to establish a mechanism whereby the Code of Ethics can be updated in the future.\nThe SSB Council has already voted in favor of this Code of Ethics. However, before the Code takes effect, we believe it is necessary to amend the SSB Governance documents (Constitution and Bylaws).\nThe proposed changes are described in detail, along with accompanying explanations, on the voting page linked below [BCO: only for members; I don’t include the link here]. The proposed amendments are also available to view in SSB’s GitHub repository, in the context of the entire SSB Constitution.\nVoting will remain open through Nov. 10th.\nAs always, thank you for your continued participation in the Society!\nThe SSB Council\n\nThis reflects a lot of work by a lot of people across SSB, the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), and the American Society of Naturalists (ASN), as well as experts outside the societies, and rounds of feedback by members and councils.\nI really hope this passes in SSB and ASN (it already did, overwhelmingly, in SSE). I talked a bit about why in my SSB Presidential address this summer (go here for materials from it, and here to jump right to the section of the speech on this area). We know misconduct happens in our field, both anecdotally and from quantitative data. One extreme response, though historically common, is ignoring it completely. Another extreme is to do things unofficially based on rumors. A good approach is to have a robust code of ethics with clear procedures. SSB Council has approved a code that has strong protections for confidentiality (but does not allow anonymous reporting), has a trained investigator get evidence in a case, and has a committee of peers decide on any possible sanctions. Now it’s up to the membership to vote on a constitution and bylaw change so the Council can implement it and tweak it as needed. Despite all the work that’s gone into it, there will likely be things that need to be adjusted in future years – this will let the Council do minor changes, while major ones will go to the membership for another vote.\nFor more on the code, go to https://www.evolutioncodeofethics.org, which has an FAQ, diagrams of how it all works, and more.\nAnd a big thank you to all the people who worked on this.

If they win half their games, they generally get to go to a bowl game. The quality of opponents can vary (some opponents are paid to play and the UTK team is expected to win many of those games) – the record against conference opponents is considered a better assessment of how the team is doing that year (and the SEC is one of the most difficult conferences). The Vols were one of the powerhouse teams for many years, then declined, but there is hope again this year (Fall 2022). The football coach is traditionally the highest paid employee of all state employees. Football coaches generally sign on for multiyear contracts: if fired they generally keep being paid (unless fired for cause, as happened in 2021), and if someone else tries to hire them away there generally is money paid to UTK in compensation (making hiring them away more expensive for competitors). UTK has a history of paying fired coaches or other personnel, though I am unaware of a comparison of UTK’s payouts with those of other schools.\n\n\nWomen’s Basketball\nSee their record here: yellow or orange rows indicate winning one or more championships.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This web page basically summarizes information from Burnham and Anderson (2002). Go there for more information.\nThe Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a way of selecting a model from a set of models. The chosen model is the one that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between the model and the truth. It’s based on information theory, but a heuristic way to think about it is as a criterion that seeks a model that has a good fit to the truth but few parameters. It is defined as:\nAIC = -2 ( ln ( likelihood )) + 2 K\nwhere likelihood is the probability of the data given a model and K is the number of free parameters in the model. AIC scores are often shown as ∆AIC scores, or difference between the best model (smallest AIC) and each model (so the best model has a ∆AIC of zero).\nThe second order information criterion, often called AICc, takes into account sample size by, essentially, increasing the relative penalty for model complexity with small data sets. It is defined as:\nAICc = -2 ( ln ( likelihood )) + 2 K * (n / ( n - K - 1))\nwhere n is the sample size. As n gets larger, AICc converges to AIC ( n - K -1 -&gt; n as n gets much bigger than K, and so (n / ( n - K - 1)) approaches 1), and so there’s really no harm in always using AICc regardless of sample size. In phylogenetics, defining “sample size” isn’t always obvious. In model selection for tree inference, sample size often refers to the number of sites (i.e., Posada and Crandall (2001)). In model selection in comparative methods, sample size often refers to the number of taxa (Butler and King, 2004; O’Meara et al., 2006).\nAkaike weights are can be used in model averaging. They represent the relative likelihood of a model. To calculate them, for each model first calculate the relative likelihood of the model, which is just exp( -0.5 * ∆AIC score for that model). The Akaike weight for a model is this value divided by the sum of these values across all models.\nBurnham, K. P., and D. R. Anderson. 2002.

I also taught an open graduate course in phylogenetic methods every spring for years as part of an NSF CAREER grant. I teach our graduate core course in evolution. I also organize and/or teach at a variety of workshops.\nA key component of teaching is mentoring students and postdocs. I’ve mentored four graduate students and fifteen postdocs directly. See here for more information."

    "text": "Service\n\nI served as an associate head for the EEB department for several years, focusing on graduate students, plus additional duties like helping to craft a covid response plan. In that role I worked to address student concerns and try to improve climate, and I continued that work as a member of EEB’s diversity committee.\nI was also the associate director for postdoctoral activities at the National Institute for Biological and Mathematical Synthesis (NIMBioS), managing training and evaluation of postdocs. Other service includes organizing things like hackathons to draw in new participants and workshops to train biologists in new tools.\nI also co-organized the iEvoBio conference for three years and helped with other biology conferences (for example, scheduling all the lightning talks at a couple of Evolution meetings).\nI’ve done workshops to help with students applying to grants, overseen grad admissions, etc.\nI have been heavily involved in the Society of Systematic Biologists, in the past serving as the communications director, a member of the council, and its president. I have also been one of the longest serving members the joint code of conduct committee for the Evolution meetings, where have been part of the team creating Safe Evolution, as well as doing IRB-approved research on climate at our meetings (poster).\nI have served as faculty advisor for Darwin Day Tennessee, one of the oldest Darwin Day events in the US (our activities now range from teacher workshops to bringing in speakers like Camile Parmesan and Neil Shubin to having giant puppets of Darwin and Wallace greet children at a birthday party for Darwin.\nI also try to make biology a better, more diverse place, whether it’s through helping sustain our department’s women in science group to talking about imposter syndrome with graduate students to finding ways to get a diverse set of applicants for our graduate program to creating a tool to allow people to self-evaluate letters of rec they are writing for words associated with biases."

The UT Knoxville-based National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) remains critically important for my work, whether by funding independent postdocs (I have mentored multiple NIMBioS postdocs, in addition to additional postdocs in my lab with other funds), sponsoring workshops, or organizing working groups."

Thank you to the search committee and everyone I met with in Minnesota – it is clearly a great department. I am keeping this page up for now as some of the resources were unknown to some of the people I met with and could be helpful, but I am no longer a candidate for the position.\nIn Feb. 2020 I applied for a position as department head for the University of Minnesota Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Department. See my February cover letter, which like most faculty position cover letters is a succinct argument for my place in the pool and probably a good place to start reading if you are pressed for time. I have made it to the interview stage in Sept. 2020 (update: withdrew from consideration in Oct. 2020). Here are materials that were relevant to my application, including both a talk on my science and, lower on the page, a talk on potential leadership of the department. You may be interested in my CV and people who have been through my lab. If you have any questions, please reach out at omeara.brian@gmail.com."

    "text": "I develop a variety of open source software and scripts. I generally use perl for scripts and C/C++ for software, but I also code in R, PHP, javascript, and Matlab.\nMajor:\n\nBrownie: Software for analyzing rate of continuous character evolution and testing for different rates in different groups. A version in beta testing allows investigation of correlation of discrete and continuous traits, many more models for discrete and continuous trait evolution, species delimitation, and more. There is even a graphical user interface! The code hosting has moved to Google code\nphylobase: I co-organized a hackathon in comparative methods in R; the project I became involved in was a new package for R for loading and manipulating phylogenetic trees and data. My main contribution, developed with Derrick Zwickl, was code to load in NEXUS files of both trees and data.\nMrFisher: MrBayes modified to do likelihood searches. It’s just being tested more before being released. Code available here\nTreeTapper: The TreeTapper site uses a mixture of PostgreSQL, PHP, and javascript to organize and display data, such as automatically linking authors to their collaborators. It’s still in very active development, but will be released once it’s stabilized. See the development blog for more info.\nPhyloRunner: PhyloRunner is a little program that allows you to double-click an icon to start a program and use Finder to navigate to the input file you want. It’s a way of running command-line only programs (r8s, recent PAUP, raxml, etc.) without having to use Terminal or learning Unix commands.\n\nMinor:\n\nSuperdouble: A header file with a new number class for C++ to reduce overflow and underflow errors (such as when calculating likelihoods on a tree and log-transforming isn’t an option). See blog post about this.\nDBGraphNav: This was proposed by me but written and largely designed by Paul McMillan, a UC Berkeley undergraduate I mentored through Google Summer of Code. It allows visual navigation of elements in a relational database by generating GraphViz image maps. It’s used in TreeTapper for coauthorship networks.\nModelPartition: A simple online tool for generating partitioned search commands for MrBayes.\nSGE scripts: A series of bash and perl scripts I use to manage my jobs on a Rocks Sun Grid Engine Cluster. It basically allows queuing on top of the SGE queue, so that if I have thousands of jobs to submit, I can do so gradually rather than preventing other users from getting on the queue.\nConcatenate nexus files script (.zip compressed): A simple perl script that takes a list of taxon names and a folder containing nexus files for individual genes and makes a new nexus file containing all the genes, dealing with missing taxa from some of the datasets appropriately, and makes charsets representing each of the genes. If the gene datasets have information on codon position from Mesquite or MacClade, this is used to make charsets for each gene and codon position, including introns.\nCompare clades script (.zip compressed): A simple perl script that takes a list of observed newick gene trees, a list of simulated newick gene trees, and a list of assigments of samples to species and uses them to count the number of times each observed tree occurs in the list of simulated trees taking into account the many to one mappings of samples to species. I.e., if species A has samples 1,2,3 and species B has samples 4,5,6, tree ((1,(2,4)),(3(5,6)) matches tree ((2,(3,6)),(1(5,4)) [because they are both ((A,(A,B)),(A(B,B))]\nProtTest to RAxML script (.zip compressed): A simple perl script that takes a ProtTest output file and runs the appropriate RAxML model. It is still a bit rough (though it seems to work), so double check (that is why it outputs info on the models it is not using). It is currently configured to start a 200 rep quick bootstrap run automatically – you can turn this off by deleting the line that says “system($systemstring)”\nResearch Tools: Software to manage collections and sequencing projects, including posting real-time information to the web and making dichotomous keys. Still in development, but see it in action on the Myrmecocystus pages.\n\nHelpful links:\n\nNexus Class Library: Allows C++ software to read NEXUS files. An older version is used in Brownie.\nwxWidgets: Cross-platform library for creation of graphical user interfaces.\nGNU Scientific Library: C code for math (linear algebra, numerical optimization, etc.).\nRod Page: Brownie uses his TreeLib.\nms: A program to simulate gene trees under various models of population structure.\nYahoo! User Interface Library (YUI): Javascript library for Ajax, tables, etc. (competing libraries are Dojo and Prototype). YUI has the best documentation and examples of any of the various javascript libraries I’ve seen."

    "text": "There are several kinds of opportunities for joining the lab.\nStandard lab policy is that you should reach out to current and past lab members for feedback on what it’s like here, and never tell me what they say, positive or negative. That way they know they can be frank with you.\nI also suggest you tell me about other things you may need – spousal accommodations, info about child care, etc. – only once you receive an official offer. I can try to work with you on ways to help, but this way, neither I nor anyone else involved can discriminate against you based on these factors, even unconsciously, before you get an offer.\nYou might look at lab guidelines to get a sense of how the lab works. Materials I created for promotion, especially the promotion packet itself (PDF) may give you a good summary of where my teaching, research, and service have been and are going. For what you might learn here, learning objectives can be helpful.\nLike anywhere, the Knoxville area has pros and cons, and everyone will have their own list of what things matter most to them and their family. In our conversations I’ll speak honestly about what I see as some of these. Some of the pros that might not be readily apparent from afar are the natural beauty of the region (it’s close to Great Smoky Mountains National Park: photos, species, website); the fact of seasons (spring and fall are spectacular here); and a collaborative department. One of the downsides is the suddenly surging housing market, making rentals difficult."

    "section": "Grad students",
    "text": "Grad students\nI am open to having new grad students start in my lab. The application deadline is December 1, 2024; the start is in August, 2025.\n\nStudents are admitted to the program, not to the lab. That means that it’s not just up to me, and if you don’t end up liking the first lab you join, moving is possible. You still have to have a faculty member saying, “I want them in my lab” to get in.\nReach out to me (email). We can talk about your interests, expectations, etc. There’s also the possibility of fee waivers for applying (not really a waiver – just that the lab will pay your fee to the graduate school). Like an increasing number of other programs that care about pulling students from a talented, diverse pool, rather than the pool who can pay to prove they know about odd numbers, parallel lines, and bar graphs (really!), we no longer require the GRE.\nI can teach you about active questions in evolution, methods use and development, programming, and more. I cannot as easily make you curious and driven. Given how our graduate program and especially how my lab runs, you shouldn’t expect to be handed a research topic from above – you will develop your research topic(s) with my help and the help of your committee. I will thus ask you to propose some concrete research ideas as a filter – it’s not a commitment that you’re going to work on them, but a way to see if you care about particular ideas.\nFor those making adequate progress, tuition is covered, as are fees, you’re in a health care plan, you get a $27K/year stipend (this has been rising over the past few years, though it still is less than the current living wage for Knoxville, TN, of $32,385). In exchange, you’re expected to TA every semester (but not summer) – the TA time load is ~20 hours per week. The stipend is paid out over all 12 months. Students also can apply for research funds (most students receive them, but in varying amounts) and of course there are other grants as well.\nGrad school is a path to many careers: governmental agencies, private companies, NGOs, academia, and more. I will try to support you in whatever career you feel is best for you (and this can change during your time in grad school), and your intended career plays no role in whether I want you in the lab or not. Do note that, like most academics, my training and professional contacts are generally in academia, but that does not mean I won’t be able to help with other careers.\nGrad school, especially for people with the intention of ending up in a tenure track job, has benefits and costs that not all people applying may know about. I have a page on this – please read it before choosing this path.\nMatt Might has a good visual guide of what it means to get a PhD (though Masters is similar; in our field, it’s ~1/3 of the research effort, but still represents a contribution to knowledge).\nRisk factors: If you move somewhere to work with someone, it’s nice to know they’ll remain there. Folks do move around in science, but I have no imminent plans to do so. I try to run my lab very transparently, so if I do start considering a move (to a different institution or into administration), I will let lab members know (unless they don’t want to be told until it’s a sure thing to reduce stress).\nFor admissions, our department considers student “quality” (nebulous: things like research experience and having a good research question help), overall balance (don’t want to admit only people working on birds one year), and priority of faculty. Pre-tenure faculty have highest priority along with people with grant funding who need to find students for their grants; after that, it’s largely based on how many students are GTA-supported in a faculty member’s lab. I have one student who will be graduating Fall, 2023, so I should be competitive in the second pool for people applying to start in August, 2024.\n\nFor application information, go to https://eeb.utk.edu/graduate-studies/application-information/. There is information at a university level for applying at https://gradschool.utk.edu/admissions/applying-to-graduate-school/. Students from countries outside the US are more than welcome. See https://gradschool.utk.edu/admissions/applying-to-graduate-school/admissions-for-international-students/ for more information (remember our department deadline of Dec. 1, which is earlier than the university deadline). Our international office can help with visas and other information (and students who have worked with this office generally find it helpful). Also note that United States national policy affects visas and related paperwork, and so what is required and permissible may change."

Instead, I typically work with students to develop research questions they care about (past ones have included Slavic language evolution and evolution of salamander development). It is like a graduate student dissertation, just shorter and perhaps more accessible. So if you have some question you’re curious about, even if it’s vague (“I really like speciation”, “Phylogenetic trees are awesome”), email me to set up a time we can talk. We can typically arrange for you to receive research credit for the research you are doing. The earlier you do this, the better – it gives you time to learn more skills to better answer your questions and really consider the biology."

Some useful references which provide broader overviews of phylogenetics are Phylogenetic Trees Made Easy by Barry Hall, chapters 11 and 12 of the somewhat dated (1996) Molecular Systematics, 2nd Edition, edited by David Hillis, Craig Moritz, and Barbara Mable, and the recently updated Molecular Systematics website. A great new resource is Joe Felsenstein’s new book Inferring Phylogenies. You may also check my page of books for phylogenetics. PAUP also has a quick start tutorial on its web page as well as a useful discussion group for asking questions. This page was last updated on February 3, 2004 , though most of its information has not been updated since June 10, 2002.\nIf you find this page useful, and think it may be useful to others, please link to it from your website.

For mixed nuclear and mitochondrial loci, choose Drosophila mtDNA.\nFor protein-coding loci, select all the characters in one exon, then go to Characters -&gt; “Codon Positions” -&gt; “Calculate Positions…”. Select the option “Choose to minimize stop codons”.\nSelect non-protein-coding regions (i.e., introns, rDNA) and go to Characters -&gt; “Codon Positions” -&gt; “Non-coding”.\nGo to Taxa -&gt; “Taxon list”.\nMove the outgroup taxa so that they are next to each other by dragging the number to the left of the taxon name.\nSelect the whole group of outgroup taxa by shift-clicking on their numbers.\nGo to Taxa -&gt; “Taxon sets” -&gt; “Store taxon set”.\nName this taxon set “outgroup”.\nDo the same for other taxa you would like in a set. Feel free to change the order of the taxa to do this.\nWhen you are done, click on the icon that looks like a Mayan pyramid, then click on one of the taxa. This alphabetizes the taxa, making later steps in PAUP easier.\nGo to File -&gt; “Print list” to print the list, along with taxon numbers.\nSave the file and quit MacClade.\nOpen PAUP 4.0b8 or higher. PAUP often has updates, so check its website to make sure you are using a recent version. Also check for bug reports.\nFrom within PAUP, open the file you just saved with MacClade. Choose “Edit”, not “Execute”.\nScroll down to below the data matrix.\nNEXUS files are arranged in blocks, starting with “BEGIN ###;” and ending with “END;”. Go to the SETS block [skip this and the next 2 instructions if you have only one locus or no coding regions].\nStart a new line. Type “CHARSET”, a space, then “###first =”, replacing ### with the name of your first coding locus.\nLook for the CODONS block. You should see something within this block that looks like “1: 1-1300\\3 1400-2700\\3”, with the numbers changed. If your first coding locus is 1302 long, for example, copy the “1-1300\\3”and place it after the equals sign in the line you just created. If your first coding locus extends all the way to 2700 in this example, just with an intron in the middle, copy the entire “1-1300\\3 1400-2700\\3” to after the equals sign in the line you just created.\nType a semicolon at the end of this line after pasting in the numbers.\nYou have just created a character set containing all the bases with the first codon position from your first coding locus. Repeat the same process for other loci, all three positions. The general format is “CHARSET [charset name] = [character numbers];”.\nYou can do the same thing with sets of taxa. You should already have a taxset named “outgroup”. You can make other taxsets using the format “TAXSET [taxset name] = [taxon numbers];”. The taxon number is the same as the number on the taxon’s left in MacClade’s taxon list window, which you have printed out. It’s also the order of taxa within the DATA block.\nCreate a PAUP block. Make sure this is after one of the “end;” lines but before the next “Begin ###;” lines. The format is “Begin PAUP;” skip a few lines, then “end;”. Don’t forget the semicolons.\nWithin the PAUP block, create a character partition. The general format is “CHARPARTITION [partition name] = [charset name 1]:[charset name 1], [charset name 2]:[charset name 2], [charset name 3]:[charset name 3];” For example, if the data consists of 28S and COI sequence, you would have a charset called 28s, another charset called coI, and the charparition command would be “CHARPARTITION locus = 28s:28s, coI:coI;” This is used in ILD tests.\nWithin the PAUP block, paste the following text:\n\noutgroup outgroup /only; set maxtrees=5000 increase=auto autoclose=no torder=right tcompress=yes taxlabels=full storebrlens=yes storetreewts=yes outroot=paraphyl;\nThis sets the outgroup to be whatever you determined in the outgroup taxset, sets a reasonable starting maxtrees number, and sets other PAUP preferences to useful ones for starting a search. Other PAUP commands can be included in the PAUP block as well.\n\nYou may find it useful to keep a running log of all analyses done. This can be helpful in checking what p-values were of various tests, how many replicates were done in a particular search, etc. To do this, paste the following text within the PAUP block:\n\nlog file=[name] append=yes replace=no;\nIf you do this, delete the log commands from other batch files (see below) so that everything is logged to one file.\nBatch files\nBatch files are ways to give PAUP commands without going through the menus (Mac) or entering items one at a time in the command line (all platforms). For example, you could set up a PAUP batch file which would do a heuristic search saving the best trees from each addition sequence replicate, save these trees to a file, filter for the best trees, and finally save these best trees to a second tree file. Batch files are also a good way to ensure consistency between searches – for example. you won’t have to remember if you used 5 or 10 addition sequence replicates per bootstrap replicate, as that information will be in the batch file. A batch file has the following format:\n#nexus [Tells PAUP that this is a NEXUS file]\nbegin PAUP; [Starts the PAUP block]\n[PAUP commands]; [Gives PAUP instructions on what to do – the same thing you enter in the command line]\nend; [Ends the PAUP block]\nTo create a batch file, first create a new document within PAUP or in some other text editor (such as SimpleText). Then type “#nexus” in the first line and “begin paup;” in the second. After that, include the PAUP commands you want – PAUP’s command reference document, available from the downloads section of its website, is invaluable in constructing these. Finally, write “end;” at the end of the document. Save the document. Now, executing the document, the same way you execute a data file, will start the commands running.\nAll the batch files on this website can be copied into a new PAUP document and executed. Several of the batch files have places to insert the name of a file or set, often appearing as [name]. Make sure that the brackets are removed: for example, if the file is called tree1, “file=[name]” should become “file=tree1”. PAUP makes batch file troubleshooting easy – if there is a problem with the file, PAUP will open the file and put the cursor where the error occured. PAUP does not see anything in brackets, so comments written there will not affect analyses. The only two exceptions to this are: 1) if the first character within the bracket is an exclamation point, PAUP will display the contents in the display buffer; and 2) Trees can have a [&U] or [&R] to tell PAUP if they are rooted or not.\nExhaustive and branch-and-bound searches (&lt;13 taxa)\nBoth these search strategies are guaranteed to find the optimal tree. However, they are not generally practical for even moderate numbers of taxa: finding the best tree is generally an NP-hardproblem. Thus, heuristic searches are necessary for most analyses.\nHeuristic searches\nHeuristic searches are not guaranteed to find the globally-optimal tree, but they can work for many more taxa than exhaustive or branch-and-bound searches. A good starting batch file is:\n\n\n#nexus\n\nbegin PAUP;\nlog file=hsearch1.log;\nset autoclose=yes;\nhsearch start=stepwise addseq=random nreps=100 savereps=yes randomize=addseq rstatus=yes hold=1 swap=tbr multrees=yes;\nsavetrees file=hsearch1.all.tre brlen=yes;\nfilter best=yes permdel=yes;\nsavetrees file=hsearch1.best.tre brlen=yes;\nlog stop;\nend; &gt; &gt;\n\nThis batch file will do a heuristic search, save all the trees found in each random addition sequence replicate in the hsearch1.all.tre file, then filter for the best trees overall and save them in an hsearch1.best.tre file. PAUP will also output a tree-island profile. A “tree-island” is a group of trees which cannot be reached through branchswapping from a different group of trees. Ideally, all the trees will be on one island which will have been hit every time, no matter what starting tree or taxon addition order. If this is the case, the treespace is fairly simple and we would probably move on to bootstrapping. If the island(s) with the best trees was hit nearly all the time, we’d probably be satisfied, as well. However, if the best trees are not recovered in many of the searches, we would need to search further.\nWe use a variety of strategies for these next searches. The first strategy is to simply increase the number of addition sequence replicates. To do this, change the nreps=100 in the batch file above to a higher number, perhaps nreps=1000. To avoid confusion, we may also want to replace “hsearch1” with “hsearch2” wherever it appears before running the search again.\nAnother strategy is to start from random trees, rather than random taxon addition. On the above batch file, change the randomize=addseq to randomize=trees, change the “hsearch#” as above, and search again, with nreps to taste.\nThese searches will run longer than the initial search. A way to speed up the search while covering more of tree space is to increase the number of addition replicates but reducing the thoroughness of the search for each replicate. We might do this if we believe there may be islands of good trees PAUP is missing. A sample batch file follows. You may want to change the nreps and timelimit.\n\n\n\n\n\n#nexus\n\nbegin paup;\nlog file=hsearch.tlimit.log;\nset maxtrees=10000 increase=auto;\nhsearch rstatus=no limitperrep=yes nreps=5000 randomize=trees timelimit=5 savereps=yes;\nsavetrees file=hsearch.tlimit.all.tre brlen=yes;\nfilter best=yes permdel=yes;\nsavetrees file=hsearch.tlimit.best.tre brlen=yes;\nend; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n\n\nThe parsimony ratchet (below) can be useful in searching treespace broadly, as well.\nParsimony ratchet\nThe parsimony ratchet is a way to search treespace by reweights characters for some iterations of a search. It is especially good for searches with large numbers of taxa. It is described by Kevin Nixon (Nixon, K. C. 1999. “The Parsimony Ratchet, a new method for rapid parsimony analysis.” Cladistics 15: 407-414). Derek Sikes and Paul Lewis have written a program, called PaupRat, which generates batch files to implement this search strategy in PAUP. A few notes on the use of this: 1) It’s better to do several searches of a moderate number of nreps in each search (create a new ratchet file for each search) than one search with many nreps; 2) It’s useful to insert the commands:\n\nstopcmd “filter best=yes permdel=yes”;\nstopcmd “savetrees file=mydata.best.tre”;\n\ninto the setup.nex file before the stopcmd “[quit]”; to automatically filter for the best trees.\nBootstrap searches\nBootstrap searches can take quite some time. One useful feature of PAUP is the ability to search on multiple computers or on several different occasions and combine the results. The key to this is saving the bootstrap trees from each search and then loading them all together, then computing the consensus tree using the tree weights. You must be sure to keep the bootstrap search settings (except for the number of bootstrap replicates) the same between searches for this to be valid. This can be done through the menus (make sure to hit the “save trees to file” checkbox in the bootstrap menu), or through the batch files (below).\nFor the search itself [the search can be stopped before completing all the bootstrap replicates; if doing multiple searches, the treefile name should be changed for each search. You may want to change the number of bootstrap replicates (currently set at 500) and the number of random taxon additions per bootstrap replicate (currently set at a low value of 10)]:\n\n#nexus\nbegin paup;\nset storetreewts=yes;\nbootstrap nreps=500 treefile=bootstrap1.tre replace=no brlen=yes/ start=stepwise addseq=random nreps=10 savereps=no randomize=addseq hold=1 swap=tbr multrees=yes;\nend;\n\nLoad all the bootstrap trees, making sure to store tree weights (an option which should have been made the default by the above batch file), to load all blocks, and NOT to eliminate duplicate trees. Executing the following batch file should set all these options and load the trees saved as bootstrap1.tre in the active folder.\n\n#nexus\nbegin paup;\ngettrees allblocks=yes duptrees=keep storetreewts=yes storebrlens=yes mode=7 file=bootstrap1.tre;\nend;\n\nFinally, compute a majority-rule consensus tree. The batch file for this is:\n\n\n\n\n\n#nexus\n\nbegin paup;\nlog file=bootstrapconsensus.log;\ncontree /majrule=yes strict=no le50=yes usetreewts=yes showtree=yes treefile=finalbootstrap.tre grpfreq=yes;\nlog stop;\nend; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n\n\nNote that this will create a bootstrap tree which will include nodes with support less than 50% which are consistent with the majority rule tree. Most authors choose to omit bootstrap numbers less than 50% while continuing to show the node; a better approach, if space allows, would be to show all bootstrap values.\nThough likelihood is far slower than parsimony, this does not mean that likelihood is too slow for bootstrapping. To speed up likelihood bootstrap searches, one can fix the values of nuisance parameters (for example, use the lset output from ModelTest) and time limit each heuristic search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecay indices, including partitioned Bremer support\nFor simple decay indices, MacClade can generate a batch file. Go to the tree window, then go to the sigma () menu -&gt; “Decay Index Paup File…”. For partitioned Bremer support, we use TreeRot (see its detailed instruction manual).\nChoosing a likelihood model\nWe generally use David Posada’s program ModelTest to determine the appropriate likelihood model. This consists of a batch file which has PAUP compute the likelihood score of a tree under various models and a program which computes the likelihood ratio test and the AIC criterion. When the two criteria choose different models, we use the likelihood ratio test result. This procedure will be brought into PAUP in one of the next updates, according to PAUP’s programmers.\nTesting for a molecular clock\nOnce the appropriate likelihood model has been selected by ModelTest, one can test for a clock. Copy the lscores line corresponding to ModelTest’s chosen model from the modelblock file and paste this over the [LSCORES] lines in the following batch file:\n\n\n#nexus\n\nbegin paup;\nset criterion=distance;\nlog file=clocktest.log;\nDSet distance=JC objective=ME base=equal rates=equal pinv=0\nsubst=all negbrlen=setzero;\nNJ showtree=no breakties=random;\nset criterion=likelihood;\nlset clock=no;\n[LSCORES];\n;[!Non-clock score above, clock score below];\nroottrees;\nlset clock=yes;\n[LSCORES];\n;[!Clock score above];\ntstatus;\nlog stop;\nend; &gt; &gt;\n\nThis will result in two ln likelihood scores. Take the difference between the scores and double it. This is your test statistic for a chi-squared test; the number of taxa minus 2 is the degrees of freedom. You can use a program such as Microsoft Excel (the chidist function) or this web site to compute the p-value. Significant p-values mean that the clock is rejected. People generally try each locus independently; if you have time, you could use ModelTest to determine the correct likelihood model for each locus, or just use the model chosen for all the loci combined.\nCalibrating the tree I: Using a previously-published calibration\nThere are generally two ways to put ages on nodes of a clock tree: 1) Use a previously-published rate of percent divergence for a particular gene versus time, or 2) Use fossil information (see next entry). Reported calibration rates often are in terms of uncorrected percent sequence divergence per million years (“uncorrected” means uncorrected for multiple hits). To use this value for your tree, compute all uncorrected pairwise distances for your taxa in PAUP. With menus, use File -&gt; Save Distances to File, then Options -&gt; Distance options and select uncorrected “p”. The batch file would be (replacing [filename] with what you want to call the distance file, without brackets):\n\n\n#nexus\n\nbegin paup;\ndset distance=p;\nsavedist format=onecolumn file=[filename] undefined=asterisk;\nend; &gt; &gt;\n\nExamine the ensuing list (in PAUP or Microsoft Excel) to find a pair of taxa which have a percent divergence similar to the ones in the taxa used in the original calibration. Using these taxa, rather than the oldest or youngest pair, makes it more likely that the proportion of uncorrected multiple hits will be the same for the calibration and the pair being used to calibrate the entire tree (the rate of uncorrected divergence versus time will go down with time as multiple hits accumulate). The calibration rate can be used to determine the age of the node separating the chosen pair of taxa. The age of the node is then used to calibrate the rest of the tree.\nCalibrating the tree II: Using fossil data\nThe rate of molecular evolution may be affected by many things: mutation rate, generation time, and perhaps even body size. A calibration based on fossil data of the group being studied may be more accurate than a calibration from other organisms. Multiple calibration points will give the most precise estimate. Record infomation about all the fossils in the group, not just the oldest. Fossils tend to give just minimum ages for the group – think about ways to determine maximum ages, as well. For example, the group may not be older than the evolution of life on land, or may not be older than the oldest possible age (which is not the age of the oldest known fossil) of an obligate host. Biogeographic information may also be useful. Fossil calibrations, and minimum ages in general, should be mapped to the stem of the clade (= the most recent common ancestor of the clade and its sister group). . Maximum ages should be mapped to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the clade constrained by that calibration (the “crown”). For example, if we have a calibration for birds using the oldest known bird fossil (a minimum age constraint), we know that the split between birds and their sister group had to happen eariler than that fossil, but not that the MRCA of the bird taxa included in our study lived before that fossil. In contrast, if we say that we know that Lepidoptera must have evolved after the first terrestrial plants (a maximum age constraint), we know that the MRCA of Lepidoptera cannot be older than that, but not that the split separating Lepidoptera from their sister group occurred after it. The total branchlength from the present to the node of each constraint on the clock tree is recorded (the units do not matter, as long as the branch lengths are proportional to time). This information, plus the age and type of the calibration constraint, are entered into an Excel sheet which calculated the maximum and minimum possible rates given all the calibration points. This can easily be done manually, as well. Each branch length is then multiplied by these rates to get the maximum and minimum length of the branch in time. Note that the rate is actually applied to the whole tree at once – the tree is stretched or compressed by the maximum or minimum rates – the ratio of the ages of nodes does not change with the different rates. Other methods must be used to calculate error bars on the ages of nodes due to finite sequence length rather than uncertain calibration. These methods are explained below.\nDetermining error bars on ages of nodes\nFor determining error bars on nodes, two methods can be used, both implemented in Sanderson’s r8s program. The first method involves looking at the shape of the likelihood surface. The second method uses bootstrapped datasets and calculates error bars from the distribution of branchlengths on the bootstrapped dataset. We have done the latter method using PAUP and Excel, due to a lack of Linux x86 computers to run r8s. First, Phylip’s SeqBoot is used to create bootstrapped datasets. These are edited in PAUP to merge them into one large dataset (for example, if the original dataset is 3000 characters long, and 500 bootstrap replicate datasets are created, they are edited to make a single 1,500,000 character dataset. A PAUP batch file is then constructed in Excel which divides the combined datasets into character sets and then has PAUP evaluate the branchlengths of the given topology (the clock tree being evaluated) for each replicate dataset (corresponding to a charset). A sample batch file is below for a dataset 2432 characters long. Some of the repetitive commands have been deleted, but the pattern should be clear. Before executing this batch file, load your long datafile, set the likelihood parameters, and load your clock tree.\n\n\n#nexus\n\nbegin paup;\ncharset rep1 = 1 - 2432 ;\ncharset rep2 = 2433 - 4864 ;\ncharset rep3 = 4865 - 7296 ;\n_[…. repetitive commands not included here. Just use Excel to follow the pattern….]\n_charset rep500 = 1213569 - 1216000 ;\nexclude all;\ninclude rep1 ; [! rep 1 ]\nsavetrees root=yes brlen=yes maxdecimals=6 replace=no append=yes file=brlenwbootstrapdata.tre;\nexclude all;\ninclude rep2 ; [! rep 2 ]\nsavetrees root=yes brlen=yes maxdecimals=6 replace=no append=yes file=brlenwbootstrapdata.tre;\nexclude all;\ninclude rep3 ; [! rep 3 ]\nsavetrees root=yes brlen=yes maxdecimals=6 replace=no append=yes file=brlenwbootstrapdata.tre;\n[…. repetitive commands not included here. Just use Excel to follow the pattern….]\nexclude all;\ninclude rep500 ; [! rep 500 ]\nsavetrees root=yes brlen=yes maxdecimals=6 replace=no append=yes file=brlenwbootstrapdata.tre;\nend; &gt; &gt;\n\nThe trees are all saved in one file with branchlengths by PAUP. This tree file is then opened within Excel, with the length of each branch put in a column. The total length of branches from the root to the node of interest is computed for each tree and divided by the distance from the root to the tips. Then the percentile function is used in Microsoft Excel to determine the 95% confidence interval on the distance from the root to the node of interest, with the distance expressed as proportion of total tree length.\nBayesian searches (MrBayes)\nBayesian phylogenetic inference is a new way of finding trees and tree support, in terms of probability of the topology given the data and your prior beliefs (or the default prior beliefs of your program). I use MrBayes for this. Good introductions to the proper use of MrBayes (such as diagnosing convergence) can be found at Frederick Ronquist’s site.\nHypothesis testing\nWe often want to test our hypotheses of evolution. For example, we may ask if the tree we get from our analysis is significantly different than the traditional phylogeny, or whether the observed paraphyly of a particular group is strongly supported, or other questions. There are several ways to do this. The first step in most of them is to create a constraint tree. Open the data file in MacClade and go to the tree window. Create a random tree. Then use MacClade’s tree drawing tools to create the constraint tree. A constraint tree for the monophyly of a certain group would have only one resolved internode branch, that between the group and the rest of the taxa. A constraint tree for a previously-existing phylogenetic hypothesis would be more resolved. Export these trees from MacClade, one at a time, naming each appropriately.\nOpen PAUP and execute the data file. Under analysis, choose load constraints (don’t load as backbone constraint). Then, depending on the analysis and optimization criterion:\nFor Bayesian analyses: Load the trees found after stationarity. Filter the trees to find those consistent with the constraint tree. The command for this is “filter constraint=[constraint name]”, where [constraint name] is replaced by the name of your constraint tree. Record the number of these trees. This number, divided by the total number of post-stationarity trees, is the posterior probability of the hypothesis represented by the constraint tree. For example, if 60 out of 1000 trees are left after filtering for trees with a certain group monophyletic, the probability of monophyly of this group is 6%.\nUnder the parsimony criterion: Perform a thorough tree search with the constraint enforced [if using a batch file, insert “enforce=yes constraint=[constraint name]” within the hsearch command (somewhere between “hsearch” and the semicolon), replacing [constraint name] with the name of your constraint]. This generates the most parsimonious tree[s] which meet this constraint. Save these trees. Then load your most parsimonious trees found without the constraint without replacing the trees you just found [go to options in the get trees window and fill in both circles, or use “gettrees mode=7 file=[tree file name];”, replacing [tree file name] with the name of your tree file]. The Templeton and winning-sites tests are the appropriate tests to use in this situation and can be selected under Trees -&gt; Tree Scores… -&gt; Parsimony, then choosing nonparametric tests. The command for this is “pscores /nonparamtest=yes;”. The Kishino-Hasegawa test, which is also available, is inappropriate when comparing trees which were not specified a priori. We often report this value anyway.\nUnder the likelihood criterion: Perform a thorough tree search with the constraint enforced [if using a batch file, insert “enforce=yes constraint=[constraint name]” within the hsearch command (between “hsearch” and the following semicolon), replacing [constraint name] with the name of your constraint]. This generates the likeliest tree which meets this constraint. Save this tree. Then load all likely trees without replacing the trees you just found [go to options in the get trees window and fill in both circles, or use “gettrees mode=7 file=[tree file name];”, replacing [tree file name] with the name of your tree file]. What “all likely trees” means is difficult. Some people include the maximum likelihood tree and the most parsimonious trees. You could also include all trees with a length no greater than 5 more than the most parsimonious trees or something like that. Then go to Trees -&gt; Tree Scores… -&gt; Likelihood, then click on the button for topology based tests. Choose the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test. This test measures whether some trees are better than others under likelihood. The Kishino-Hasegawa test, one many people use, is inappropriate (non-conservative) unless all the trees have been specified a priori (specified without using any of the data for a tree search). We often report the value anyway, though noting it’s not valid.\nTree drawing and editing\nTo prepare trees for publication, we use Acrobat PDF Writer. This printer extension allows trees to be saved as PDF files from PAUP, complete with correct branchlengths, scale bars, titles, and bootstrap proportions. These trees may then be opened in Adobe Illustrator and have branches colored, line thicknesses changed, keys added, etc. The trees can be saved in PDF format or output to other formats for publication."

Here (Wired, soft paywall) is an accessible overview of RSS and how to read it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n     \n     \n       Order By\n       Default\n         \n          Title\n        \n         \n          Date - Oldest\n        \n         \n          Date - Newest\n        \n     \n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams College stops seeking federal grants\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrants\n\n\nfinancing\n\n\n\nWilliams College announced it will stop seeking federal research grants – running numbers on impact\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodical cicadas\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncicadas\n\n\nnatural history\n\n\n\nThe long wait is over: periodical cicadas are here!\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding for tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNSF\n\n\nNIH\n\n\ntenure\n\n\nfunding\n\n\nindirect costs\n\n\n\nFaculty funding should not play a role in tenure decisions, especially now\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow long does balance in eponymous names require?\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntaxonomy\n\n\nbirds\n\n\nrstats\n\n\n\nAn analysis of data from Sanster (2025) on eponymous birds\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 28, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty and risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNSF\n\n\nREU\n\n\ngradschool\n\n\nfunding\n\n\n\nHow we communicate and handle risks to students from federal funding uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 31, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield safety\n\n\nfieldwork\n\n\nsafety\n\n\nNSF\n\n\ninclusion\n\n\n\nInfo on field safety protocols\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 8, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDentist for likelihood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nRstats\n\n\nlikelihood\n\n\nuncertainty\n\n\npublication\n\n\n\nA new way to estimate uncertainty in likelihood\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 29, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13,000 page site with Rmarkdown and targets\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub\n\n\nsoftware\n\n\nrstats\n\n\nhighered\n\n\ntargets\n\n\nrmarkdown\n\n\n\nHow I made a site comparing every higher ed institution in the US\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSB Code of Ethics\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode of ethics\n\n\nSSB\n\n\nsystematics\n\n\nethics\n\n\n\nSSB is voting on a code of ethics\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 26, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFraction of history\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhistory\n\n\nmastodon\n\n\n\nFigure out what fraction of history you have lived through\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 1, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGithub rate limit\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub\n\n\nsoftware\n\n\nrstats\n\n\n\nHow to fix the bad credentials error with devtools::install\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrad core class in evolutionary biology, 2023 edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nteaching\n\n\nevolution\n\n\ncore\n\n\nEEB511\n\n\n\nTopics and teaching in our core class in evolution for graduate students\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining Mastodon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsocial media\n\n\n\nInstructions for joining mastodon for social media\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 30, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative to CRAN for phylogenetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nrbloggers\n\n\nreproducibility\n\n\n\nPhylotastic R-universe as a way of serving up phylogenetics packages in R\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 23, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFossils do not help fix diversification parameter estimates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfossil\n\n\nR\n\n\nhisse\n\n\nmisse\n\n\ndiversification\n\n\nsimulation\n\n\npublication\n\n\n\nOverview of ‘Fossils Do Not Substantially Improve, and May Even Harm, Estimates of Diversification Rate Heterogeneity’, published in Systematic Biology in 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 22, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
