Students and postdocs in my lab will (eventually) find these very funny. This is how you know your education is complete. They are all from the web comic [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) by Randall Munroe. There are two implementations of this drawing style in R: a general plotting one at [https://xkcd.r-forge.r-project.org/](https://xkcd.r-forge.r-project.org/) and one for phylogenies in [phytools](https://blog.phytools.org/2012/10/new-test-version-of-phytools-v02-02.html).
