### Eugenics analysis

<https://github.com/bomeara/EugenicsPublicationAnalysis>. Note that as I'm not sure about licensing for downloaded Web of Science data, it starts one step after the actual run process, after all the downloaded files have been aggregated. See the readme for more. It uses R and `targets` for a workflow.
