Lately I have been getting this error on occasion when running `devtools::install()` in R:

```
> devtools::install()
Error: HTTP error 401.
  Bad credentials

  Rate limit remaining: 59/60
  Rate limit reset at: 2023-07-27 21:55:54 UTC
```

The solution, from <https://community.rstudio.com/t/unable-to-install-packages-from-github/124372>, is to do

```
Sys.unsetenv("GITHUB_PAT")
```

There have been past reports on this in the devtools package, but it was apparently fixed some time ago. I am using Mac OS 13.4, R 4.2.3. This line does fix it, though.
