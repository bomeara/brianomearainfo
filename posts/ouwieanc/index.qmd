`OUwie` is an R package developed by [Jeremy Beaulieu](https://www.jeremybeaulieu.org/) and, to a [lesser extent](https://github.com/thej022214/OUwie/graphs/contributors), [James Boyko](https://jamesboyko.com/) and me. [One part](https://github.com/thej022214/OUwie/blame/master/R/OUwie.anc.R) I worked on was ancestral state estimation: reconstructing states on the phylogeny. This is very dangerous. Normally, we have N tips, each with one trait: we know that trying to estimate all the parameters of a model can be hard or even impossible (OUwie now tries to check for the latter). With ancestral state reconstruction, we now try to estimate what is happening at N-1 nodes. In the US a popular thing is to bet on [college basketball brackets](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2023-04-18/2023-ncaa-bracket-scores-stats-march-madness-mens-tournament): a balanced tree of 32 teams, where each node represents a game, and you must reconstruct which team wins each game.
