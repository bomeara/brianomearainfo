<p>EEB 464 Macroevolution Fall 2018</p>
<p>Instructor: Dr. Brian C. O’Meara</p>
<p>Office hrs: 11-12 M and by appointment; 446 Hesler</p>
<p>Meeting time: 10:10-11:00 MWF, 412 Buehler</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The course is a lecture format course with classroom discussion and
participation. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts in
macroevolution including current areas of debate (drivers of
evolutionary rates, modes of speciation, etc.) and taught to think
critically. Computer-based exercises, especially simulations, will allow
students to learn how processes acting on short to medium time scales
affect long term patterns. 3 credits</p>
<p>To understand macroevolution, it is important to learn about who, what,
where, when, how, and why.</p>
<p>Who: Organisms</p>
<p>What: Non-living context (rocks from space, environmental conditions)</p>
<p>Where: Biogeography (on Pangaea or Bermuda?)</p>
<p>When: Geological time scale</p>
<p>How: Pattern of evolution</p>
<p>Why: Process of evolution</p>
<p>The course will cover all these areas. The ones that are most
interesting, of course, are the how and especially the why. These are
also the best to cover in class, where there can be discussion and other
interaction. Rote learning (word meanings and the like) is something
that you should be able to do on your own at this point in your
education, with occasional guidance. We’re not going to use much class
time on this, but you will have to learn this info. I will clearly
describe what you do have to learn (and if it’s not clear, ASK), and
quizzes and tests will be ways to evaluate your progress and provide
further incentive to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Biology program learning objectives:</strong></p>
<p>I include how this course addresses these in <em>italics.</em></p>
<p>Explain and provide examples of each the five big ideas in Biology,
using their knowledge of biological concepts gained from their course of
study:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Evolution: Populations of organisms and their cellular components
have changed over time through both selective and non-selective
evolutionary processes. <em>This is the main point of the course, and
will be covered in every lecture and activity.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Structure and Function: All living systems (organisms, ecosystems,
etc.) are made of structural components whose arrangement determines
the function of the systems. <em>This will be highlighted especially in
the discussions of morphological evolution (flight, insects, etc.)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Information Flow and Storage: Information (DNA, for example) and
signals are used and exchanged within and among organisms to direct
their functioning. <em>Origin of life will cover this extensively.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Transformations of Energy and Matter: All living things acquire,
use, and release and cycle matter and energy for cellular /
organismal functioning. <em>The discussion of escalation focuses on
this, and it comes up in background on the focal organisms.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Systems: Living systems are interconnected, and they interact and
influence each other on multiple levels. <em>Speciation, extinction,
discussion, and history of life all cover this.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Demonstrate the ability to perform the following scientific practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Formulate empirically-testable hypotheses. <em>This is the point of the
final presentation.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Interpret visual representations (figures and diagrams). <em>These will
come up throughout the class, especially in the context of
phylogenetic trees.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate data and come to a conclusion (with evidence) (formulate an
argument). <em>Much of class discussion emphasizes this skill: I’ll
present information and have you elaborate on this and provide
potential explanations.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Course learning objectives:</strong></p>
<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Formulate, defend, and critically evaluate hypotheses about
evolutionary mechanisms</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the context and reason for evolutionary patterns</p></li>
<li><p>Interpret information from fossils, phylogenies, and other data
sources</p></li>
<li><p>Generate ideas for feasible, compelling scientific projects</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To really understand evolution and converse with other scientists, you
have to know the names of some groups (imagine trying to talk about the
history of some musical genre without knowing the names of any musicians
or songs in that genre). Thus, most days, you will be responsible for
learning about a particular taxon (on the syllabus, below). This could
be a single species or a clade of many species. You should learn very
basic info: what is it, what is it related to (i.e., where it attaches
to the tree of life we will grow over the class), why it is important to
know. For example: “Angiosperms: all flowering plants, lots of species,
became common in the Cretaceous but may have originated earlier, sister
to Gnetales.” Working together on the website forum to get this info is
encouraged (you can decide to rotate the job, let whoever gets the info
first post it, etc.). What I really care about is that you learn it.
Note that some of the taxa may be subsets of the other taxa (elephants
are a kind of vertebrate).</p>
<p>Writing and presentations will be graded on a variety of levels, such as
grammar, structure, and substance. The purpose of grading and comments
is to improve your writing. Remember that your writing is being graded,
not you.</p>
<p>Word count sets a minimum length (and references are not counted) but
you may go a bit longer if needed (try to keep below 125% of required
length). Since length is judged by words, not page length, please don’t
do any odd formatting of your paper (huge or tiny margins, font sizes of
8 or 18, etc.) to try to meet some page limits.</p>
<p>Papers/midterms will be turned in via the course website (Canvas). This
eliminates issues with printers, odd file formats, and the like. The
site will automatically check your work for possible plagiarism. I do
this in all my classes with written work. Except where noted,
assignments are to be done individually. You must cite and reference
work properly. <strong>When in doubt about citation, plagiarism, or
collaboration, ASK.</strong> Please turn in work as plain text or RDF. This
makes it easier for me to put them in one document so I can give you
back grades with comments.</p>
<p>For help with submitting documents online, see
<a href="http://online.utk.edu/students/assignment.shtml" class="uri">http://online.utk.edu/students/assignment.shtml</a>. There is a practice
uploading assignment that will allow you to test to make sure you can
upload files correctly before the pressure of a deadline. If there is a
problem at the moment of a deadline, email me your work instead to
verify it is done on time (but normally you should be using Canvas).</p>
<p>Communication is very important. I have set up a forum on the Canvas
site for our course. If you post a question there, I will immediately be
emailed about it and will respond on the forum (though perhaps not
immediately). Emailing me directly will not be any faster (though do
email me if the issue is better addressed one-on-one). The benefit of
using the forum is that everyone can see the answers and there’s a
chance that one of the other students will answer the question first.
Feel free to use the forum for other class-related discussions.</p>
<p>Though we have the main Canvas site, and notices will come through
there, I will also be posting things (like slides) to
<a href="http://brianomeara.info/category/macroevolution/" class="uri">http://brianomeara.info/category/macroevolution/</a> . Why a second site?
The Canvas site is only active during the course and only to students
enrolled in the course. You might want to look at the materials in other
semesters, show your friends/family what you were learning, etc., so I
have the public site that will persist.</p>
<p>Attendance is expected at all classes, though missing a class or two due
to illness, family problem, etc. might happen (and is strongly suggested
in the case of flu: <a href="http://studenthealth.utk.edu/common_avoidflu.php" class="uri">http://studenthealth.utk.edu/common_avoidflu.php</a> )</p>
<p>We will have discussions in nearly all classes. You should participate
in them. Sometimes, discussions in a class such as this consist of
students trying to return the right answer to the instructor’s question.
To avoid this, sometimes I pursue a policy of not talking during a
discussion for several minutes or longer so you have to talk to each
other. This can result in complete silence. If you find this annoying,
talk! Even if there is not a formal discussion, please ask questions at
any point during class.</p>

</table>
<p>Late work is penalized at 10%/day (so something turned in 49 hours late
is given a score 70% of what it would have received on the due date).
Extensions are not normally granted, except under extraordinary
circumstances (having too much work to do does not qualify, for
example). Remember that even if you turn something in seven days late,
it is still worth more points than not turning it in at all (and the
grading for the class is just #points received / #points available, so
something getting 20/100 points is still worth twice something getting
10/100 points, even though they are both an “F” individually).</p>
<p>My goal is to have you learn. If you are having trouble with something
in the course, or if there is a topic you just have to learn more about,
let me know (email, office hours, online forum, etc.). Faculty often use
evaluations at the end of the semester to get info from students so we
can improve before the next class, but this does not help you directly.
<strong>To allow the class to improve while you are taking it, I have created
a site for anonymous feedback at
<a href="http://brianomeara.info/teaching/feedback/" class="uri">http://brianomeara.info/teaching/feedback/</a></strong> (and yes, it is really
anonymous). Let me know things that are going well or poorly — both
are important. I might not implement all your suggestions, but they will
all be read and considered, generally the same day you submit them.</p>
<p>Any student who feels s/he may need an accommodation based on the impact
of a disability should contact me privately to discuss specific needs.
Please contact the Office of Disability Services at 865-974-6087 in
Dunford Hall to coordinate reasonable accommodations for students with
documented disabilities.</p>
<p>All relevant University policies (including, but not limited to,
policies on academic integrity, attendance, etc.) apply to this course.
In the case of any conflict between the policies in this syllabus and
University policy, University policy applies. The instructor reserves
the right to revise, alter, and/or amend this syllabus as necessary.
Students will be notified by email of any such revisions, alterations,
and/or amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
<p>100 points: Topic review. 1000 words, including references. Cover a
macroevolutionary question: what is known about it, what is the state of
work on it, what work might be done in the future? Work should be
individual.</p>
<p>100 points: Pair presentation. Imagine you are trying to get money to
study a macroevolutionary question. You have to make a compelling case
to a potential funder (i.e., the NSF will give you $15K to study it, or
a professor might offer you a place in her lab to work on this). You
should include 1) why that question is interesting (this should include
what is known about it), 2) how you plan to address it, 3) what
potential outcomes of your work may be, and 4) the implications of
these. 10 minute talk (PowerPoint, Keynote, PDF, etc.). Be sure to
include references in your slides.</p>
<p>50 points: Class work. This includes quizzes, activities, and other in
class assignments. In general, these will not be announced in advance.
Note that 80 points will actually be assigned but the maximum score
possible will be 50 points. The goal of this is to allow you to miss
some classes (due to illness, death in the family, or other such
reasons) without needing to bring a note justifying your absence.</p>
<p>100 points each: Take home midterms. You may NOT work with classmates or
other humans, but you can use notes, books, papers, etc. (though do not
plagiarize them, not that the questions will be ones you can typically
plagiarize).</p>
<p>200 points: Final exam. Similar to the midterm, but with a bit more
evaluation of rote knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition to these assignments, students will periodically be given
articles to read for later discussion. Quizzes or other assignments will
assess whether the articles have been read.</p>
<p>Final letter grades will be assigned at the end of the semester using an
instructor-specified scale. I aim for grading consistency across years
and with other courses at UTK.</p>
