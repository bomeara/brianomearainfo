      <description>Here’s my syllabus (PDF, docx) for Bio150. This course is taught in parallel by multiple instructors: we have a shared set of topics to teach, and the same textbook, but then it is up to each instructor to develop her or his section. Mine this semester has 235 students. I will do a mixture of active learning, traditional lecturing, and other activities. In the past I had students use an app I wrote to find local species; this semester I am moving to use iNaturalist instead.</description>

      <description>I typically record videos of all my lectures and post them to YouTube. In my lectures, I may include a video clip or two available on YouTube, often from the BBC or a similar source of high quality videos. I make sure to credit these appropriately, and of course they’re being used as short clips, educationally, with no ads or other commercial benefit to me. However, the BBC has lately been quite vigorous in scrubbing YouTube of any of my lectures with their content.</description>

      <description>This is Biodiversity 130, Spring 2012. It is a course covering basic evolution and a walk through various taxa. The main site content is set up on Blackboard (behind a log in wall). You may want to check out the Lampyr web/iOS app being developed as part of this course. The syllabus is here.
