464 Macroevolution Fall 2018\nInstructor: Dr. Brian C. O’Meara\nOffice hrs: 11-12 M and by appointment; 446 Hesler\nMeeting time: 10:10-11:00 MWF, 412 Buehler\nDescription:\nThe course is a lecture format course with classroom discussion and participation. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts in macroevolution including current areas of debate (drivers of evolutionary rates, modes of speciation, etc.) and taught to think critically. Computer-based exercises, especially simulations, will allow students to learn how processes acting on short to medium time scales affect long term patterns. 3 credits\nTo understand macroevolution, it is important to learn about who, what, where, when, how, and why.\nWho: Organisms\nWhat: Non-living context (rocks from space, environmental conditions)\nWhere: Biogeography (on Pangaea or Bermuda?)\nWhen: Geological time scale\nHow: Pattern of evolution\nWhy: Process of evolution\nThe course will cover all these areas. The ones that are most interesting, of course, are the how and especially the why. These are also the best to cover in class, where there can be discussion and other interaction. Rote learning (word meanings and the like) is something that you should be able to do on your own at this point in your education, with occasional guidance. We’re not going to use much class time on this, but you will have to learn this info. I will clearly describe what you do have to learn (and if it’s not clear, ASK), and quizzes and tests will be ways to evaluate your progress and provide further incentive to learn.\nBiology program learning objectives:\nI include how this course addresses these in italics.\nExplain and provide examples of each the five big ideas in Biology, using their knowledge of biological concepts gained from their course of study:\n Evolution: Populations of organisms and their cellular components have changed over time through both selective and non-selective evolutionary processes. This is the main point of the course, and will be covered in every lecture and activity.\n Structure and Function: All living systems (organisms, ecosystems, etc.) are made of structural components whose arrangement determines the function of the systems. This will be highlighted especially in the discussions of morphological evolution (flight, insects, etc.)\n Information Flow and Storage: Information (DNA, for example) and signals are used and exchanged within and among organisms to direct their functioning. Origin of life will cover this extensively.\n Transformations of Energy and Matter: All living things acquire, use, and release and cycle matter and energy for cellular / organismal functioning. The discussion of escalation focuses on this, and it comes up in background on the focal organisms.\n Systems: Living systems are interconnected, and they interact and influence each other on multiple levels. Speciation, extinction, discussion, and history of life all cover this.\n  Demonstrate the ability to perform the following scientific practices:\n Formulate empirically-testable hypotheses. This is the point of the final presentation.\n Interpret visual representations (figures and diagrams). These will come up throughout the class, especially in the context of phylogenetic trees.\n Evaluate data and come to a conclusion (with evidence) (formulate an argument). Much of class discussion emphasizes this skill: I’ll present information and have you elaborate on this and provide potential explanations.\n  Course learning objectives:\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n Formulate, defend, and critically evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms\n Understand the context and reason for evolutionary patterns\n Interpret information from fossils, phylogenies, and other data sources\n Generate ideas for feasible, compelling scientific projects\n  To really understand evolution and converse with other scientists, you have to know the names of some groups (imagine trying to talk about the history of some musical genre without knowing the names of any musicians or songs in that genre). Thus, most days, you will be responsible for learning about a particular taxon (on the syllabus, below). This could be a single species or a clade of many species. You should learn very basic info: what is it, what is it related to (i.e., where it attaches to the tree of life we will grow over the class), why it is important to know. For example: “Angiosperms: all flowering plants, lots of species, became common in the Cretaceous but may have originated earlier, sister to Gnetales.” Working together on the website forum to get this info is encouraged (you can decide to rotate the job, let whoever gets the info first post it, etc.). What I really care about is that you learn it. Note that some of the taxa may be subsets of the other taxa (elephants are a kind of vertebrate).\nWriting and presentations will be graded on a variety of levels, such as grammar, structure, and substance. The purpose of grading and comments is to improve your writing. Remember that your writing is being graded, not you.\nWord count sets a minimum length (and references are not counted) but you may go a bit longer if needed (try to keep below 125% of required length). Since length is judged by words, not page length, please don’t do any odd formatting of your paper (huge or tiny margins, font sizes of 8 or 18, etc.) to try to meet some page limits.\nPapers/midterms will be turned in via the course website (Canvas). This eliminates issues with printers, odd file formats, and the like. The site will automatically check your work for possible plagiarism. I do this in all my classes with written work. Except where noted, assignments are to be done individually. You must cite and reference work properly. When in doubt about citation, plagiarism, or collaboration, ASK. Please turn in work as plain text or RDF. This makes it easier for me to put them in one document so I can give you back grades with comments.\nFor help with submitting documents online, see http://online.utk.edu/students/assignment.shtml. There is a practice uploading assignment that will allow you to test to make sure you can upload files correctly before the pressure of a deadline. If there is a problem at the moment of a deadline, email me your work instead to verify it is done on time (but normally you should be using Canvas).\nCommunication is very important. I have set up a forum on the Canvas site for our course. If you post a question there, I will immediately be emailed about it and will respond on the forum (though perhaps not immediately). Emailing me directly will not be any faster (though do email me if the issue is better addressed one-on-one). The benefit of using the forum is that everyone can see the answers and there’s a chance that one of the other students will answer the question first. Feel free to use the forum for other class-related discussions.\nThough we have the main Canvas site, and notices will come through there, I will also be posting things (like slides) to http://brianomeara.info/category/macroevolution/ . Why a second site? The Canvas site is only active during the course and only to students enrolled in the course. You might want to look at the materials in other semesters, show your friends/family what you were learning, etc., so I have the public site that will persist.\nAttendance is expected at all classes, though missing a class or two due to illness, family problem, etc. might happen (and is strongly suggested in the case of flu: http://studenthealth.utk.edu/common_avoidflu.php )\nWe will have discussions in nearly all classes. You should participate in them. Sometimes, discussions in a class such as this consist of students trying to return the right answer to the instructor’s question. To avoid this, sometimes I pursue a policy of not talking during a discussion for several minutes or longer so you have to talk to each other. This can result in complete silence. If you find this annoying, talk! Even if there is not a formal discussion, please ask questions at any point during class.\n   Date Topic Taxon to have learned Assignment       22-Aug   Pre-test, syllabus            1   24-Aug   History of planet \u0026amp; life   Crinoid       2   27-Aug   History of planet \u0026amp; life   Archaea       3   29-Aug   Evidence   Bdelloid rotifers       4   31-Aug   Taphonomy   Trilobite         3-Sep   Labor Day         5   5-Sep   Jargon   Acromyrmex       6   7-Sep   Phylogenetics   Ammonite       7   10-Sep   Empirical distributions   Ichthyornis dispar       8   12-Sep   Biogeography   HIV       9   14-Sep   Speciation   Wolbachia       10   17-Sep   Speciation   Anomalocaris       11   19-Sep   Extinction   Gasterosteus aculeatus       12   21-Sep   Extinction   Geospizinae   Midterm 1 distributed     13   24-Sep   Diversification   Dionaea muscipula       14   26-Sep   Diversification   Tribolium       15   29-Sep   Natural selection \u0026amp; drift   bonobo   Midterm 1 due at 8 pm     16   1-Oct   Sex   Lichen       17   3-Oct   Trends   Fig wasp         5-Oct   Fall break         18   8-Oct   Symbiosis   Anolis       19   10-Oct   Game theory   Tunicates       20   12-Oct   Inclusive fitness   Brachiopod       21   15-Oct   Systematics   Spiny anteater       22   17-Oct   Darwin   Eubacteria   Paper due at 8 pm     23   19-Oct   Flight   Maiasaura       24   22-Oct   Invasive humans   Isopod       25   24-Oct   Disease evolution   Ground sloth       26   26-Oct   Origin of life   Thermus aquaticus   Midterm 2 distributed     27   29-Oct   Contemporary evolution   Lycophytes       28   31-Oct   Insects   Strepsiptera       29   2-Nov   Stephen Jay Gould   Diatom   Midterm 2 due at 8 pm     30   5-Nov   Language evolution   Dimetrodon       31   7-Nov   Discoveries from past month   Buchnera       32   9-Nov   Evolution of intelligence   Welwitschia       33   12-Nov   Domestication   Solanum tuberosum       34   14-Nov   Evolutionary medicine   Plasmodium       35   16-Nov   Free topic 1   Ginkgo       36   19-Nov   Free topic 2   silversword       37   21-Nov   Free topic 3   orca         24-Nov   Thanksgiving break         38   26-Nov   Presentations     Presentation     39   28-Nov   Presentations     Presentation     40   30-Nov   Presentations     Presentation     41   3-Dec   Review           10-Dec   Final exam 10:15 am - 12:15 pm         Late work is penalized at 10%/day (so something turned in 49 hours late is given a score 70% of what it would have received on the due date). Extensions are not normally granted, except under extraordinary circumstances (having too much work to do does not qualify, for example). Remember that even if you turn something in seven days late, it is still worth more points than not turning it in at all (and the grading for the class is just #points received / #points available, so something getting 20/100 points is still worth twice something getting 10/100 points, even though they are both an “F” individually).\nMy goal is to have you learn. If you are having trouble with something in the course, or if there is a topic you just have to learn more about, let me know (email, office hours, online forum, etc.). Faculty often use evaluations at the end of the semester to get info from students so we can improve before the next class, but this does not help you directly. To allow the class to improve while you are taking it, I have created a site for anonymous feedback at http://brianomeara.info/teaching/feedback/ (and yes, it is really anonymous). Let me know things that are going well or poorly — both are important. I might not implement all your suggestions, but they will all be read and considered, generally the same day you submit them.\nAny student who feels s/he may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss specific needs. Please contact the Office of Disability Services at 865-974-6087 in Dunford Hall to coordinate reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.\nAll relevant University policies (including, but not limited to, policies on academic integrity, attendance, etc.) apply to this course. In the case of any conflict between the policies in this syllabus and University policy, University policy applies. The instructor reserves the right to revise, alter, and/or amend this syllabus as necessary. Students will be notified by email of any such revisions, alterations, and/or amendments.\nGrading:\n100 points: Topic review. 1000 words, including references. Cover a macroevolutionary question: what is known about it, what is the state of work on it, what work might be done in the future? Work should be individual.\n100 points: Pair presentation. Imagine you are trying to get money to study a macroevolutionary question. You have to make a compelling case to a potential funder (i.e., the NSF will give you $15K to study it, or a professor might offer you a place in her lab to work on this). You should include 1) why that question is interesting (this should include what is known about it), 2) how you plan to address it, 3) what potential outcomes of your work may be, and 4) the implications of these. 10 minute talk (PowerPoint, Keynote, PDF, etc.). Be sure to include references in your slides.\n50 points: Class work. This includes quizzes, activities, and other in class assignments. In general, these will not be announced in advance. Note that 80 points will actually be assigned but the maximum score possible will be 50 points. The goal of this is to allow you to miss some classes (due to illness, death in the family, or other such reasons) without needing to bring a note justifying your absence.\n100 points each: Take home midterms. You may NOT work with classmates or other humans, but you can use notes, books, papers, etc. (though do not plagiarize them, not that the questions will be ones you can typically plagiarize).\n200 points: Final exam. Similar to the midterm, but with a bit more evaluation of rote knowledge.\nIn addition to these assignments, students will periodically be given articles to read for later discussion. Quizzes or other assignments will assess whether the articles have been read.\nFinal letter grades will be assigned at the end of the semester using an instructor-specified scale. I aim for grading consistency across years and with other courses at UTK.\n ","date":1534903586,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534903586,"objectID":"87b9c84445fec5745aaf54c467a17a58","permalink":"/_posts/macroevolution-2018-syllabus/","publishdate":"2018-08-22T02:06:26Z","relpermalink":"/_posts/macroevolution-2018-syllabus/","section":"_posts","summary":"EEB 464 Macroevolution Fall 2018\nInstructor: Dr. Brian C.

This has some interesting methods in it, but I think the key importance of the paper is its focus on nonequilibrium dynamics and interactions between traits: it took tens of millions of years for angiosperms to evolve the key floral trait combinations that led to fast diversification. http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1830/20152304\n Beaulieu and O’Meara 2016. This paper describes a new method for looking at traits leading to diversification that also allows for unexamined traits to have some or all of the effect. The importance of this paper is the focus on using models to help learn new things about organisms, rather than just rejecting trivial nulls: “Surprise is a necessary part of discovery that, to put it bluntly, has been relatively lacking in trait-dependent diversification studies until now. With HiSSE we can still test our intuitions about a particular character, but we can also discover that rates seem to be driven by some unknown and unmeasured character state, allowing the data to help us generate new hypotheses” https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/65/4/583/1753616\n Jackson, Morales, Carstens, and O’Meara, 2017. This describes software for examining multiple phylogeographic hypotheses. Most current approaches focus on a testing a few key hypotheses, or have constraints such as not allowing gene flow between diverging populations. This approach lets biologists examine a wide variety of hypotheses about possible histories of connections and subdivision between populations (later work extends this for species delimitation with gene flow). https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syx001\n   Promotion process The process involves discussion and decisions based on the promotion materials (provided by the candidate and also review letters), plus information generated at each level (votes, summaries of decisions).

We are assuming that the change in shape of the tree is given by a shift in the diversification rates (like a mass extinction) and not because of diversity dependence (we will test this in the next section). Input for the simulation will be:\n 10 extant species\n lambdavect=c(2,0.1), this represents a shift in birthrate\n muvect=c(0,0.05), this represents a shift in extinction rate\n All species are sampled before and after the change in diversification rates\n time=c(0,1) the shift in rate occure 1 unit of time ago (i.e. mya)\n We do not see lineages extinct\nset.seed(1) #tree1\u0026lt;-sim.rateshift.taxa()[[1]]\n  Plot the tree and the lineage through time. Do you notice the “pull of the present”?

Three parameters are of importance (K, lambda_n, mu) mu is fixed but not zero, lambda_n depends on the number of lineages and K is the carrying capacity. For this part we will use function bd.densdep.optim in TreePar there are faster options in DDD and expoTree (not very intuitive). What are the input choices for bd.densdep.optim?

We will use the whale examples in this tutorial. To run your own analysis, it is a good idea to simply modify the example controlfile or use the template controlfile.\nLet’s start the whale analysis and then look at the controlfile.\nRun the Whales It is easiest to use BAMM when all files are in the same directory where BAMM is, so:\nmove the whale tree and the controlfile in the same folder as BAMM\n to get a result that is looking a bit more realistic, we open the ‘divcontrol’ file and change numberOfGenerations from 10k to 1Mio\n change the directory of your command line to that folder\n start the analysis by typing:\n  \u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;sourceCode r\u0026quot;\u0026gt;./bamm -c divcontrol.txt \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;co\u0026quot;\u0026gt;# on windows you can omit the \u0026#39;./\u0026#39;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; wait for the MCMC to start running\n the output files will be\n   chain_swap.txt\n event_data.txt\n mcmc_out.txt\n prior_probs.txt\n run_info.txt\n  The main data we want to look at later is in the event_data file, and we look at the file mcmc_out to assess convergence. You might want to keep the run_info file with your other files in order to know what settings you used for a specific analysis.\n A look at the controlfile Go to the examples folder and find the ‘whales’ controlfile and tree in the ‘diversification’ subfolder. Open the controlfile ‘divcontrol.txt’. The file is pretty well annotated and most points should be fairly self-explanatory, we will quickly discuss some of them though.\nSections:\n General Setup and Data Input\n Priors\n MCMC Simulation Settings \u0026amp; Output Options\n Operators: MCMC Scaling Operators\n Operators: MCMC Move Frequencies\n Initial Parameter Values\n Metropolis Coupled MCMC\n Numerical and Other Parameters\n  Most values are preset in a way that will work out well, and most users work along the policy to not touch anything if you don’t know what it does, but a few parameters are worth looking at (the bold ones you definitely have to modify for your own analysis, or at least consider it…):\n modeltype\n treefile\n useGlobalSamplingProbability\n globalSamplingFraction\n sampleProbsFilename\n all the priors…\n numberOfGenerations\n mcmcWriteFreq\n eventDataWriteFreq\n printFreq\n acceptanceRateFreq\n scaling operators…\n move frequencies…\n initial values…\n numberOfChains\n deltaT\n swapPeriod\n minCladeSizeForShift\n segLength\n  More in-depth treatment of how to fine-tune the analysis and how to use advanced features can be found here\n  Analyse outputs with BAMMtools Now we want to dig into the outputs of the analysis, which we do in R. There are a number of different options regarding what we can do and should do, and we try to look at the most important ones here.\nConvergence Just like for any MCMC analyses, e.g. when we date a tree with BEAST, we want to know if we ran the analysis long enough to reach convergence.

I have it here in HTML as well as .docx and .pdf. Course announcements will come through the official BlackBoard site but materials will appear here, where they are available to all.\nEEB 464 Macroevolution Fall 2015 Instructor: Dr. Brian C. O’Meara Office hrs: 1:30-2:30 M and by appointment; 446 Hesler Meeting time: 10:10-11:00 MWF, 488 Dabney Description: The course is a lecture format course with classroom discussion and participation. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts in macroevolution including current areas of debate (drivers of evolutionary rates, modes of speciation, etc.) and taught to think critically. Computer-based exercises, especially simulations, will allow students to learn how processes acting on short to medium time scales affect long term patterns. 3 credits\nTo understand macroevolution, it is important to learn about who, what, where, when, how, and why.\nWho: Organisms What: Non-living context (rocks from space, environmental conditions) Where: Biogeography (on Pangaea or Bermuda?) When: Geological time scale How: Pattern of evolution Why: Process of evolution\nThe course will cover all these areas. The ones that are most interesting, of course, are the how and especially the why. These are also the best to cover in class, where there can be discussion and other interaction. Rote learning (word meanings and the like) is something that you should be able to do on your own at this point in your education, with occasional guidance. We’re not going to use much class time on this, but you will have to learn this info. I will clearly describe what you do have to learn (and if it’s not clear, ASK), and quizzes and tests will be ways to evaluate your progress and provide further incentive to learn.\nBiology program learning objectives: I include how this course addresses these in italics. Explain and provide examples of each the five big ideas in Biology, using their knowledge of biological concepts gained from their course of study:\n Evolution: Populations of organisms and their cellular components have changed over time through both selective and non-selective evolutionary processes. This is the main point of the course, and will be covered in every lecture and activity.\n Structure and Function: All living systems (organisms, ecosystems, etc.) are made of structural components whose arrangement determines the function of the systems. This will be highlighted especially in the discussions of morphological evolution (flight, insects, etc.)\n Information Flow and Storage: Information (DNA, for example) and signals are used and exchanged within and among organisms to direct their functioning. Origin of life will cover this extensively.\n Transformations of Energy and Matter: All living things acquire, use, and release and cycle matter and energy for cellular / organismal functioning. The discussion of escalation focuses on this, and it comes up in background on the focal organisms.\n Systems: Living systems are interconnected, and they interact and influence each other on multiple levels. Speciation, extinction, discussion, and history of life all cover this.\n  Demonstrate the ability to perform the following scientific practices:\n Formulate empirically-testable hypotheses. This is the point of the final presentation.\n Interpret visual representations (figures and diagrams). These will come up throughout the class, especially in the context of phylogenetic trees.\n Evaluate data and come to a conclusion (with evidence) (formulate an argument). Much of class discussion emphasizes this skill: I’ll present information and have you elaborate on this and provide potential explanations.\n  Course learning objectives: By the end of this course, students will be able to:\n Formulate, defend, and critically evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms\n Understand the context and reason for evolutionary patterns\n Interpret information from fossils, phylogenies, and other data sources\n Generate ideas for feasible, compelling scientific projects\n  To really understand evolution and converse with other scientists, you have to know the names of some groups (imagine trying to talk about the history of some musical genre without knowing the names of any musicians or songs in that genre). Thus, most days, you will be responsible for learning about a particular taxon (on the syllabus, below). This could be a single species or a clade of many species. You should learn very basic info: what is it, what is it related to (i.e., where it attaches to the tree of life we will grow over the class), why it is important to know. For example: “Angiosperms: all flowering plants, lots of species, became common in the Cretaceous but may have originated earlier, sister to Gnetales.” Working together on the website forum to get this info is encouraged (you can decide to rotate the job, let whoever gets the info first post it, etc.). What I really care about is that you learn it. Note that some of the taxa may be subsets of the other taxa (elephants are a kind of vertebrate). Writing and presentations will be graded on a variety of levels, such as grammar, structure, and substance. The purpose of grading and comments is to improve your writing. Remember that your writing is being graded, not you. Word count sets a minimum length (and references are not counted) but you may go a bit longer if needed (try to keep below 125% of required length). Since length is judged by words, not page length, please don’t do any odd formatting of your paper (huge or tiny margins, font sizes of 8 or 18, etc.) to try to meet some page limits. Papers/midterms will be turned in via Online@UT. This eliminates issues with printers, odd file formats, and the like. The site will automatically check your work for possible plagiarism. I do this in all my classes with written work. Except where noted, assignments are to be done individually. You must cite and reference work properly. When in doubt about citation, plagiarism, or collaboration, ASK. Please turn in work as plain text or RDF. This makes it easier for me to put them in one document so I can give you back grades with comments. For help with submitting documents online, see http://online.utk.edu/students/assignment.shtml. There is a practice uploading assignment that will allow you to test to make sure you can upload files correctly before the pressure of a deadline. If there is a problem at the moment of a deadline, email me your work instead to verify it is done on time (but normally you should be using BlackBoard).\nWe will be using laptops for some work in class. If you see the laptop cart in the classroom, take a laptop. When class is done, please return them to the cart and plug them in. Take care of them when you are using them. Some of our work will use the statistical analysis package R (http://www.r-project.org/). It is free and work on Mac, Linux, and Windows. For some class activities (announced beforehand) it will be convenient to bring a laptop. If you do not have one, groups can pair up. If you wish to prepare your laptop beforehand, install R on your computer. Then, within R:\ninstall.packages(“ctv”) library(ctv) install.views(“Phylogenetics”)\n(you can do this with the graphical user interface as well).\nCommunication is very important. I have set up a forum on the BlackBoard site (Online@UT) for our course. If you post a question there, I will immediately be emailed about it and will respond on the forum (though perhaps not immediately). Emailing me directly will not be any faster (though do email me if the issue is better addressed one-on-one). The benefit of using the forum is that everyone can see the answers and there’s a chance that one of the other students will answer the question first. Feel free to use the forum for other class-related discussions.\nThough we have the main BlackBoard site, and notices will come through there, I will also be posting things (like slides) to http://brianomeara.info/category/macroevolution/ . Why a second site? The BlackBoard site is only active during the course and only to students enrolled in the course. You might want to look at the materials in other semesters, show your friends/family what you were learning, etc., so I have the public site that will persist.\nAttendance is expected at all classes, though missing a class or two due to illness, family problem, etc. might happen (and is strongly suggested in the case of flu: http://studenthealth.utk.edu/common_avoidflu.php )\nWe will have discussions in nearly all classes. You should participate in them. Sometimes, discussions in a class such as this consist of students trying to return the right answer to the instructor’s question. To avoid this, sometimes I pursue a policy of not talking during a discussion for several minutes or longer so you have to talk to each other. This can result in complete silence. If you find this annoying, talk! Even if there is not a formal discussion, please ask questions at any point during class.\nWe will be using Turning Point clickers in this class. Many of you will already have them from UT. They cost about $50 at the bookstore and can be used throughout your remaining career here. Note that you while you cannot use someone else’s from this class, you should be able to borrow a friend’s who is not in this class (as long as you use that same one consistently). See the Blackboard site for more on how to use clickers. Our class is now large enough that keeping track of participation manually is infeasible. I would like everyone to have a clicker by Aug 31.\nLate work is penalized at 10%/day (so something turned in 49 hours late is given a score 70% of what it would have received on the due date). Extensions are not normally granted, except under extraordinary circumstances (having too much work to do does not qualify, for example). Remember that even if you turn something in seven days late, it is still worth more points than not turning it in at all (and the grading for the class is just #points received / #points available, so something getting 20/100 points is still worth twice something getting 10/100 points, even though they are both an “F” individually).\nMy goal is to have you learn. If you are having trouble with something in the course, or if there is a topic you just have to learn more about, let me know (email, office hours, online forum, etc.). Faculty often use evaluations at the end of the semester to get info from students so we can improve before the next class, but this does not help you directly. To allow the class to improve while you are taking it, I have created a site for anonymous feedback at http://brianomeara.info/teaching/feedback/ (and yes, it is really anonymous). Let me know things that are going well or poorly — both are important. I might not implement all your suggestions, but they will all be read and considered, generally the same day you submit them.\nAny student who feels s/he may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss specific needs. Please contact the Office of Disability Services at 865-974-6087 in Dunford Hall to coordinate reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.\nAll relevant University policies (including, but not limited to, policies on academic integrity, attendance, etc.) apply to this course. In the case of any conflict between the policies in this syllabus and University policy, University policy applies. The instructor reserves the right to revise, alter, and/or amend this syllabus as necessary. Students will be notified by email of any such revisions, alterations, and/or amendments.\n    Date  Topic  Taxon to have learned  Assignment       19-Aug   Pre-test, syllabus            1   21-Aug   History of planet \u0026amp; life   Crinoid       2   24-Aug   History of planet \u0026amp; life   Archaea       3   26-Aug   Evidence   Bdelloid rotifers       4   28-Aug   Taphonomy   Trilobite       5   31-Aug   Jargon   Acromyrmex       6   2-Sep   Phylogenetics   Ammonite       7   4-Sep   Empirical distributions   Ichthyornis dispar         7-Sep   Labor Day         8   9-Sep   Biogeography   HIV       9   11-Sep   Speciation   Wolbachia       10   14-Sep   Speciation   Anomalocaris       11   16-Sep   Extinction   Gasterosteus aculeatus       12   18-Sep   Extinction   Geospizinae   Paper due at 8 pm     13   21-Sep   Diversification   Dionaea muscipula       14   23-Sep   Diversification   Tribolium       15   25-Sep   Natural selection \u0026amp; drift   bonobo       16   28-Sep   Sex   Lichen       17   30-Sep   Trends   Fig wasp       18   2-Oct   Symbiosis   Anolis   Midterm distributed     19   5-Oct   Game theory   Tunicates       20   7-Oct   Inclusive fitness   Brachiopod       21   9-Oct   Systematics   Spiny anteater       22   12-Oct   Darwin   Eubacteria   Midterm due at 8 pm     23   14-Oct   Escalation   Maiasaura         16-Oct   Fall break         24   19-Oct   Flight   Isopod       25   21-Oct   Dominance   Riftia pachyptila       26   23-Oct   Invasive humans   Ground sloth       27   26-Oct   Disease evolution   Thermus aquaticus       28   28-Oct   Origin of life   Lycophytes       29   30-Oct   Contemporary evolution   Strepsiptera       30   2-Nov   Insects   Diatom       31   4-Nov   Stephen Jay Gould   Dimetrodon       32   6-Nov   Language evolution   Buchnera       33   9-Nov   Discoveries from past month   Welwitschia       34   11-Nov   Evolution of intelligence   Ginkgo       35   13-Nov   Free topic 1   silversword       36   16-Nov   Free topic 2   orca       37   18-Nov   Free topic 3   Cordyceps       38   20-Nov   Presentations     Presentation     39   23-Nov   Presentations     Presentation     40   25-Nov   Presentations     Presentation       27-Nov   Thanksgiving break         41   30-Nov   Review           4-Dec   Final exam 8 - 10 am   Sorry.       UTK_2015_Fall_EEB464_SyllabusV01.pdfGrading: 100 points: Topic review. 1000 words, including references. Cover a macroevolutionary question: what is known about it, what is the state of work on it, what work might be done in the future? Work should be individual. 100 points: Pair presentation. Imagine you are trying to get money to study a macroevolutionary question. You have to make a compelling case to a potential funder (i.e., the NSF will give you $15K to study it, or a professor might offer you a place in her lab to work on this). You should include 1) why that question is interesting (this should include what is known about it), 2) how you plan to address it, 3) what potential outcomes of your work may be, and 4) the implications of these. 10 minute talk (PowerPoint, Keynote, PDF, etc.). Be sure to include references in your slides. 150 points: Class work. This includes clicker questions (many of which have points regardless of the answer), quizzes, and other in class assignments. In general, these will not be announced in advance. Note that 180 points will actually be assigned but the maximum score possible will be 150 points. The goal of this is to allow you to miss some classes (due to illness, death in the family, or other such reasons) without needing to bring a note justifying your absence. 100 points: Take home midterm.

Faculty members are responsible for teaching, research, and service; of the three, research may be the least understood (one common misconception is that professors only teach; we teach, but contributing new knowledge in addition to disseminating existing knowledge is also a major part of our jobs), so I start with that, though all are important. I also try to explain the unfamiliar parts of the job so you can get a sense of what I do. I am currently an associate professor.\nResearch A major duty of a science professor, especially at a research-intensive place like U. of Tennessee, Knoxville, is to expand human knowledge through her or his research efforts. I work in a variety of areas to do this.\n Species discovery: One area is figuring out how many species are actually present within a group. We often think of new species being discovered by, say, an astute observer seeing a weird fish in a market, or on an expedition to a remote area of the jungle, but in fact many new species are discovered as a result of data showing that what we thought was one species was actually two different species with limited or no interbreeding: see examples of tapirs or even African elephants. I develop some of the techniques we use to make these discoveries. This matters for basic biology: it is hard for scientists to communicate information without having names for biologically meaningful groups, and it is important to understand what leads to and maintains separate groups, but it also matters in the applied area: it is hard to conserve species properly if we do not recognize what they are (we might wipe out a species that we didn’t realize was independent, or might devote resources to saving a \"species’ that is actually just a variant of a common species and lose another species due to finite resources).\n I also develop methods for looking at past history of life. For example, we have methods that can give information about how species have multiplied through time: do they exchange genes for a long time, has their population crashed at some point in the past, etc. This helps us understand how the current world came to be, but also may be useful in predicting what will happen as life and the environment continue to change.\n One major research focus has been developing approaches for looking at how and why traits change over time. For example, if you look in many environments you see more flowering plants than nonflowering plants like pines and ferns – why is this? Or questions like, once most of the dinosaurs (birds survived) went extinct, did mammals’ body size rapidly increase or was it gradual?\n One way I accomplish my research goals, as well as help others, is by writing software. It’s one thing to have an idea of how to solve a problem, but if you write a program to do this, then you and others can actually use the method to solve a problem. My software is free and open source. This means anyone can use it without paying me money (which makes sense, as my work has already been directly or indirectly paid for by taxpayers). It also means that anyone can look inside the software to see how it works. For example, here is an example of some of the code I wrote as a grad student; you can see how people have used it by looking at the hundreds of articles that cite it (though some are citing just the method, not using the software itself). Another important aspect of open source software is that not only can you look at it, you can build on it to make new software, without needing my permission, as long as you make it clear that you’re reusing my software, give appropriate credit, and release your software under the same rules (allowing reuse, showing the code, etc.). Building on others’ work, while giving them credit, is one of the key ways science advances. Making software open also lets others check for errors and try to reproduce studies.\n  There are various other research topics; look here for more info.\nResearch Funding This research requires funding to move forward. In some ways, running a lab is like running a small business (my father cofounded and ran a small print shop, so I have seen some of what this entails). You need some money to get it off the ground for necessary equipment, people, and space. After that, potential clients have needs, and you have to make the case that you’re the best group to fulfill those needs: evidence that you can make a great cake for their wedding, design a building that will get their company noticed, or reliably cut their grass twice a month. Seed funding in science typically comes from the university; at the time a faculty member is hired, there is a negotiation between the university and the candidate over what is needed for the faculty member to be successful. That money typically has to be spent down in two or three years to get the lab off the ground. After that, money comes in from clients. The typical client in my area is the US government’s National Science Foundation. It puts out calls for work in particular areas: programs to train students, software to take advantage of massive investments in computers and sensors, or data to get more information on how life has changed over time. Hundreds of scientists turn in written proposals in response to each call, often including preliminary work to show the feasibility of their proposal. Other scientists review these proposals and evaluate them on the basis of two main criteria: intellectual merit and broader impacts. Intellectual merit is things like the importance to science of what the work will do and feasibility of the work. Broader impacts is benefit to society: improving commercial companies, providing information important for policy decisions or national security, improving the nation’s infrastructure for research and education, or helping to make participants in science more representative of the country as a whole. The NSF then takes these scientists’ opinions of the proposals into account, but also other considerations (making sure scientists just starting out have a chance at funds, for example), and decides which scientists get the grants. NSF requires annual reports to monitor progress; for big grants, it may do more intensive oversight (like sending scientists out to do a site visit at where the science is being done). The university typically takes about a third of each grant to cover ongoing infrastructure and other costs associated with supporting scientific research; the rest goes into equipment, travel and salaries (sometimes including salary for a professor: we typically get paid for nine months of work and can get paid out of a grant to work over the summer (which, frankly, nearly everyone does anyway, even without a grant: continuing to do experiments, write up results, mentor grad students, etc)). You can see an example of one of my funded proposals (including the broader impacts, scientific impact, and detailed budget), here (PDF). Funding is very competitive: in my areas, funding rates may be as low as 8%, meaning for every twelve grants applied for, you might get one (and some major programs limit people to no more than two grants per year, so it can take years to be successful). I have been very lucky in getting grants. For example, in one main program at NSF, the Division of Environmental Biology, 11,789 people applied for grants from 2006-2014; only a quarter got any grants. In terms of number of grants, I was tied for 15th place out of 11,789 applicants (four grants: a dissertation improvement grant and three regular grants; I’ve since gotten another grant from a different part of NSF, and a CAREER grant from NSF). [This isn’t a way scientists usually think about such things, by the way – there’s a large amount of luck involved in getting grants once you’re in the tier of good proposals, so there’s really no reason to assume that someone with three grants is doing better or more work than someone with no grants; we usually focus much more on scientific outputs (ideas, papers, software, data, students produced), which are what really matter. However, for a general audience, this measure might be more intuitive]. In addition to their main role in supporting science, these grants help Tennessee’s economy; the approximately $2.2M of funds I have been awarded over the past six years are predicted to create about 53 jobs (using a rough estimate from here). Less approximately, my funding has directly supported four scientists and their families in Knoxville, all drawn here to work on this science.\n  Teaching Of course, another major role for faculty is teaching and mentoring. I teach introductory biology courses of around 200 students covering ecology, evolution, and an overview of life’s diversity. I created a mixed senior- and graduate-level course on major themes and ideas in evolution that I teach to about 30 students annually. This was inspired in part by a similar course I was lucky enough to take from Steve Gould and Dick Lewontin as an undergrad. I teach part of our introductory course for graduate students, covering why we can use phylogenetics to understand ecology and evolution and how to do so. I also teach numerous smaller seminar-style courses mostly for graduate students. Last year (Spring 2016) I taught a 235-student introductory biology course as well as created a new, online and in person graduate course in phylogenetic methods, where materials (exercises, videos) are free to all to use. Scientists often go around the world giving talks on their research; I do that, but I also do short workshops for training in software or methods to students in places like Brazil, Sweden, Switzerland, Ohio, North Carolina, Louisiana, and even here in Tennessee. I also talk to students in local elementary schools. I also mentor students. Undergrads can learn to do research in my lab (given my rather theoretical work, few of our biology students have opted in to this, but there have been some notable exceptions): I help them design projects and then help them gain the skills to address them. I have four PhD students in my lab (one is coadvised with another faculty member) who get more intensive training and even more independence. Graduate students also form a committee of, in our department, typically four faculty members including their main advisor. Their committee helps advise them in aspects of their work where an outside view can be helpful and helps maintain academic standards across a program. I currently serve on approximately a third of our department’s grad students’ committees, as well as for students outside our department. Finally, I mentor postdocs. These are scientists who have their PhD and thus extensive research experience but who do not yet have a permanent position. Mentoring can include expanding their skill sets into a different area of biology or math, helping them put their work in a broader context, and helping them apply for faculty jobs or for jobs outside of academia. I have mentored eleven postdocs so far. Slightly more than half were funded by the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS), which is housed at UT Knoxville campus (and which has resulted in over 400 scientific publications, 4900 visits from mathematicians and biologists from all over the world, and $35M of federal funding into Tennessee), and the remainder from support from my own grants or other funds.\n Service The third part of my job is service. These are things that are key to proper functioning of a department, or serve a purpose outside of our department, but aren’t directly research or teaching. For example, our department is attractive to grad students (good mentors, opportunities for important research, guaranteed support to students making adequate progress) and so we receive far more applicants than we can admit. I help decide which of these applicants we can admit, based on their application info (letters of rec, research experience, application essays, and other information) and factors in our department. Peer review is critically important in science: before getting something published (or a grant funded) other scientists in the field (in some ways, your competitors) have to volunteer their time, usually anonymously, to review your work and suggest changes before it can be published. These scientists don’t get paid for this; it’s just accepted as one of the duties that come with the job. It’s as if Toyota couldn’t start selling its new minivan until engineers at Honda, Chrysler, and Kia had finished checking it out and making recommendations about it. This can be a painful process, but it can really make the final work that gets published better. I participate as a reviewer for many scientific journals as well as funding agencies. Outreach is also a part of service; I do this through advising the student group Darwin Day TN, maintaining an overview of software for phylogenetics in R, helping to organize scientific conferences, and many other activities.\n ","date":1439431596,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1439431596,"objectID":"33b00019b44a1c52e56a2b8fc3518944","permalink":"/general/general/","publishdate":"2015-08-13T02:06:36Z","relpermalink":"/general/general/","section":"","summary":"Most of my website is designed for a specialized scientific audience, but it is important to include a summary for a general audience: taxpayers, colleagues outside of science, and so forth.

I generally use perl for scripts and C/C++ for software, but I also code in R, PHP, javascript, and Matlab.\nMajor:\n Brownie: Software for analyzing rate of continuous character evolution and testing for different rates in different groups. A version in beta testing allows investigation of correlation of discrete and continuous traits, many more models for discrete and continuous trait evolution, species delimitation, and more. There is even a graphical user interface! The code hosting has moved to Google code\n phylobase: I co-organized a hackathon in comparative methods in R; the project I became involved in was a new package for R for loading and manipulating phylogenetic trees and data. My main contribution, developed with Derrick Zwickl, was code to load in NEXUS files of both trees and data.\n MrFisher: MrBayes modified to do likelihood searches. It’s just being tested more before being released. Code available here\n TreeTapper: The TreeTapper site uses a mixture of PostgreSQL, PHP, and javascript to organize and display data, such as automatically linking authors to their collaborators. It’s still in very active development, but will be released once it’s stabilized. See the development blog for more info.\n PhyloRunner: PhyloRunner is a little program that allows you to double-click an icon to start a program and use Finder to navigate to the input file you want. It’s a way of running command-line only programs (r8s, recent PAUP, raxml, etc.) without having to use Terminal or learning Unix commands.\n  Minor:\n Superdouble: A header file with a new number class for C++ to reduce overflow and underflow errors (such as when calculating likelihoods on a tree and log-transforming isn’t an option). See blog post about this.\n DBGraphNav: This was proposed by me but written and largely designed by Paul McMillan, a UC Berkeley undergraduate I mentored through Google Summer of Code. It allows visual navigation of elements in a relational database by generating GraphViz image maps. It’s used in TreeTapper for coauthorship networks.\n ModelPartition: A simple online tool for generating partitioned search commands for MrBayes.\n SGE scripts: A series of bash and perl scripts I use to manage my jobs on a Rocks Sun Grid Engine Cluster. It basically allows queuing on top of the SGE queue, so that if I have thousands of jobs to submit, I can do so gradually rather than preventing other users from getting on the queue.\n Concatenate nexus files script (.zip compressed): A simple perl script that takes a list of taxon names and a folder containing nexus files for individual genes and makes a new nexus file containing all the genes, dealing with missing taxa from some of the datasets appropriately, and makes charsets representing each of the genes. If the gene datasets have information on codon position from Mesquite or MacClade, this is used to make charsets for each gene and codon position, including introns.\n Compare clades script (.zip compressed): A simple perl script that takes a list of observed newick gene trees, a list of simulated newick gene trees, and a list of assigments of samples to species and uses them to count the number of times each observed tree occurs in the list of simulated trees taking into account the many to one mappings of samples to species. I.e., if species A has samples 1,2,3 and species B has samples 4,5,6, tree ((1,(2,4)),(3(5,6)) matches tree ((2,(3,6)),(1(5,4)) [because they are both ((A,(A,B)),(A(B,B))]\n ProtTest to RAxML script (.zip compressed): A simple perl script that takes a ProtTest output file and runs the appropriate RAxML model. It is still a bit rough (though it seems to work), so double check (that is why it outputs info on the models it is not using).

If you are interested in joining it, please contact me. Like most researchers, I seek independent, creative thinkers. Students should have a strong interest in evolutionary biology or other areas of biology (ecology, epidemiology) where the application or development of phylogenetic techniques would be helpful. Experience with math and programming is desirable but not strictly required. Do not let lack of some particular skill discourage you from applying – passion for the work is most important (though passion plus competence is better). You can see current and past last members here: ask any of them for a candid assessment of working here (and please do not tell me what they say, positive or negative, lest this possibility color what they tell you. They already provide feedback with face to face meetings and the anonymous feedback form). Our lab focuses on development and application of new techniques, not acquisition of datasets. However, we have numerous collaborations with empiricists, so students (esp. grad students) seeking to spend part of their time on an empirical project should have the opportunity to do so. To apply to postdoc here, for right now shoot me an email (bomeara@utk.edu) with a CV, statement of why you are interested in and fit for the position, and a link to some sample code. I will be setting up sites for the available postdoc positions shortly. You may also be interested in NIMBioS postdoctoral fellowships, which are independent postdocs (like NESCent postdocs were) at the math-bio interface. To apply to graduate school in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (PhD and MS), see here. The deadline is Jan. 1, annually. Students are generally admitted with the intention of working with a particular faculty member, so it is important to contact her or him early in the process. The department only admits as many students as can be funded. In my experience so far with UTK EEB graduate students, they appear happy and productive. Creating skilled, thoughtful researchers is a focus of the department. Cost of living in Knoxville is surprisingly low (do a comparison yourself – a typical grad stipend of over $19K here is equivalent to $28K in Boston or $35K in San Francisco), especially given that the city itself is culturally vibrant, has good schools and health care, and is nestled in a beautiful environment. Admitted students are funded through TAships. However, there are other sources of funding available (often through a competition), such as NSF Graduate Student Fellowships (due in early to mid-November), PEER funding (for underrepresented minority students, which can include gender, ethnicity, first in family to go to college, etc.), SCALE-IT (for students who want training in applying computational tools to biology), and NIMBios TAships and RAships. Undergraduates interested in UTK should see this site. See here for deadlines. Contact me for opportunities in my lab, especially if you have project ideas. The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBios), recently created at UTK, has several opportunities for those who want to work with me, people in my lab, or any of the other faculty, postdocs, or students at UTK, NIMBios, or Oak Ridge National Labs, as well as those who want to forge collaborations with researchers around the world with or without involvement of local researchers. These include postdoctoral fellowships, sabbatical fellowships, and short term visitor funding (1-4 weeks), as well as the opportunity for working groups and investigative workshops. Having NIMBioS here is like being a crocodile on a wildebeest migration route: hundreds of scientists working on the interface of math and biology thunder by, ripe for interaction. We have access to hundreds of computation nodes to use for simulations or other analyses, and so far, each lab member has gotten use of a Mac pro desktop at work with multiple monitors. Below, you can see the layout for the grad student/postdoc space – my office is right across the hall.\nOur lab space is intended to be handicapped-accessible (though it has not been certified), though the hilly topography of campus is frankly not ideal for those with limited mobility. However, see UTK’s Office of Disability Services for information on available accommodations. For new mothers, there is a room for pumping in a building connected to the lab by an enclosed bridge (about 150 feet, door-to-door) and a somewhat nicer space (I’ve been told) in Ayres hall, across the street from the lab. Parents can apply to have their children enroll in the on-campus Early Learning Center (infant through kindergarten) though of course there are many other childcare options. We have had moderate success with helping spouses also in science find opportunities in Knoxville; do not tell me about spouse/child/etc. issues while applying (so there is no opportunity for unconscious discrimination) but once you have the offer, please let me know what I can do to help.\n","date":1437181513,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437181513,"objectID":"29026891243ab08dfdefcfc51a8d15bb","permalink":"/lab/lab/","publishdate":"2015-07-18T01:05:13Z","relpermalink":"/lab/lab/","section":"","summary":"My lab is at the U. of Tennessee, Knoxville.

In the lag time between submission and publication, you can see my manuscripts on bioRxiv.\nTrait evolution Work in our lab most usually focuses on trait evolution, with most emphasis on methods that allow heterogeneity over the tree. For example, O’Meara et al. (2006) developed a method that allows the rate of Brownian motion to vary over a tree. This can be used to test ideas about rate evolution (Collar et al. 2009; Collar et al. 2010) and has been cited 150 times (according to Google Scholar in Aug. 2012). This work has been extended to deal with shifting rates, strengths of attraction, and means under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (Beaulieu et al. 2012). Similarly, we have developed a model for different rates of gene loss on different parts of a tree (O’Meara 2007) and methods for looking at hidden rates for discrete characters (Beaulieu et al. 2014). A review of methods in general has been published (O’Meara 2012b) where I tried to show connections across methods. We have also looked at empirical datasets, often plants, to understand evolutionary processes (eg., Zanne et al. 2013, Williams et al. 2014, Cornwell et al. 2014).\n Species delimitation / gene tree-species tree messiness The fact that gene trees and containing species trees has become increasingly apparent through work by many researchers. While this is often seen as a problem, our lab used information from gene tree-species tree conflict to estimate species boundaries and a species tree simultaneously, without requiring a priori specification of potential groups (O’Meara 2010). Ongoing work in collaboration with Bryan Carstens has resulted in a draft program to broaden this approach to phylogeography.\n Phylogenetic inference To do something useful with a phylogeny first requires getting the phylogeny, perhaps with dates. Various publications have come from inferring trees (Driskell et al. 2004; Abercrombie et al. 2011), developing new implementations for dating trees (Smith and O’Meara 2012), and defending the need for trees (Smith and O’Meara 2009).\n Software The point of what we do is to foster new discoveries about biology, especially about macroevolutionary processes. Availability of methods seems to be rate-limiting in many cases: once a new method appears, a flurry of empirical activity uses it to test long-standing hypotheses or infer new patterns. For this to happen, methods have to be available in software. Our work with iPlant (Goff et al. 2011) has aimed to make comparative methods more scalable and accessible, through the iPlant discovery environment and through our recent work on the rPlant interface to iPlant tools. Work in R in general has become a recent trend, ranging from porting existing code to R (Stack et al. 2011) to maintaining a task view of all R packages that deal with phylogenetics (O’Meara 2012a).

In my lab, we develop and apply phylogenetic tools to address evolutionary questions.\n[caption id=“attachment_960” align=“alignright” width=“361”][](http://www.brianomeara.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-23-at-8.51.11-AM.jpg) Diversification diagram using HiSSE (from Beaulieu \u0026amp; O’Meara, 2016)[/caption]\nThey are usually generated by a direct research need: how can we tell whether this group is evolving at a different rate? How can we choose between phylogeographic models without limiting ourselves to a pre-selected small set? Is there hidden variation in states that lets some herbaceous plants retain the ability to make wood while others have lost this ability? By developing techniques to address these questions, we both solve the original question and enable other biologists to use these new techniques to answer more questions. Broadly, the areas covered include trait evolution, species delimitation, phylogeography, dating trees, and more work in progress.\nResearch I work on empirical systems in collaboration with others as well as other kinds of studies, but many people coming to this website are probably most interested in methods developed here. Some highlights:\n Species delimitation: Brownie (O’Meara 2009), which has nonparametric and parametric species delimitation: it returns a species tree and species assignments without first requiring assignment of individuals to populations, and phrapl (Jackson et al., 2017), which allows delimitation in the presence of gene flow.\n Continuous trait evolutionary rates: Different rates for Brownian motion were first in Brownie (O’Meara, Ané, Sanderson, and Wainwright, 2006), then RBrownie (no longer on CRAN), and are available in R in Liam Revell’s phytools. We later made flexible Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models that allow the mean, variance, and attraction parameters to change on the tree. This is in the R package OUwie (Beaulieu, Jhwueng, Boettiger, and O’Meara, 2012).\n Discrete trait models: Sometimes all you see is a binary state, but this hides a lot of complexity. For example, we can code plants as “woody” or “herbaceous”, but are all herbaceous plants the same? It’s possible that some still have the genes for producing wood and can readily re-evolve woodiness, but others cannot. Most methods treat these the same, but we allow hidden states: in this case, the hidden state might be “having genes for woodiness”. This is in the R package corHMM (Beaulieu, O’Meara, and Donoghue 2013).\n Discrete trait diversification models: BiSSE models are popular but can have issues with spurious correlations, as well as treating all taxa with a given observed trait as the same. We have what we think is a solution in HiSSE.\n Phylogeography:Often in phylogeography we look at just a handful of models. In other cases, models must be restricted in some way, by, say, prohibiting migration. What if there were something like ModeTest but for phylogeography rather than nucleotide models? We have developed software, phrapl, for this.\n  [caption id=“attachment_1538” align=“alignright” width=“256”]PHRAPL model for three populations[/caption]\n Dating: Stephen Smith and I worked on a reimplementation of Mike Sanderson’s penalized likelihood to scale to large trees: treepl (Smith and O’Meara 2012). If you can get it installed, it works well. I am also working on datelife.org, a repository of chronograms inspired by TimeTree but with an eye for reusability.\n DNA/AA evolution: Read a recent phylogeny paper: they probably used GTR+G or a similar model, perhaps partitioned. We know far more about how DNA evolves than can be fit in a few parameter model, but a full, free codon model is generally too parameter-rich to fit, either. We have a method selac that can combine models for mutation on nucleotides with selection on amino acids.\n In the pipeline: We have an improvement to the DEC model of Ree and Smith, approaches for doing comparative method on networks, rather than trees, ways to flexibly make complex models, and more, in prep. You can get a sense of this by looking at what people in the lab are working on.\n  See more info on research here.\n Teaching I’ve taught everything from 200-person introductory biology courses to small graduate reading groups. Every Fall I teach a macroevolution course for upper level undergraduate students and graduate students. I now teach (sponsored by an NSF CAREER grant) an open graduate course in phylogenetic methods every spring. I also organize and/or teach at a variety of workshops. A key component of teaching is mentoring students and postdocs. I’ve mentored four graduate students and fifteen postdocs directly. See here for more information.\nService I have increasingly been involved in service. Part comes from organizing things like hackathons to draw in new participants and workshops to train biologists in new tools. I also co-organized the iEvoBio conference for three years and helped with other biology conferences (for example, scheduling all the lightning talks at a couple of Evolution meetings). I am also now an associate head for our EEB department with a focus on graduate students. I’ve also done workshops to help with students applying to grants, overseen grad admissions, etc. I have been heavily involved in the Society of Systematic Biologists, in the past serving as the communications director and a member of the council. I am also the associate director for postdoctoral activities at the National Institute for Biological and Mathematical Synthesis (NIMBioS), managing training and evaluation of postdocs. I am also the faculty advisor for Darwin Day Tennessee, one of the oldest Darwin Day events in the US (our activities now range from teacher workshops to bringing in speakers like Camile Parmesan and Neil Shubin to having giant puppets of Darwin and Wallace greet children at a birthday party for Darwin. I also try to make biology a better, more diverse place, whether it’s through helping sustain our department’s women in science group to talking about imposter syndrome with graduate students to finding ways to get a diverse set of applicants for our graduate program.\n  Funding In the last eight years, work in the lab has been funded by five NSF grants to me as PI or Co-PI as well as awards from iPlant, Encyclopedia of Life, and Google Summer of Code to me or people doing work in the lab (see more info here). Grad students in the lab have been supported by teaching assistantships as well as a PEER fellowship. The UT Knoxville-based National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) remains critically important for my work, whether by funding independent postdocs (I have mentored seven NIMBioS postdocs, in addition to three additional postdocs in my lab with other funds), sponsoring workshops, or organizing working groups.\n ","date":1437180361,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437180361,"objectID":"67fd5ff0665e93c71a13df43fa1db5fb","permalink":"/home/home/","publishdate":"2015-07-18T00:46:01Z","relpermalink":"/home/home/","section":"","summary":"Most of this website is written for a specialist scientific audience; folks who aren’t scientists are very welcome to look around, but this page might be a more accessible introduction.

Describe a major event (such as a mass extinction, colonization of land, etc.) and its subsequent effects. How do we learn about organisms with no living descendants, such as trilobites? How would living descendants affect how we can learn about them? Can behavior be fossilized? If so, give two examples. How can something become a fossil? How has continental drift affected the location of organisms? Why don’t barracuda eat cleaner wrasse? Why bother making phylogenies? What is a phylogeny? Can species be treated as independent data points in a statistical analysis? Why or why not? How can movement of land lead to speciation? What was the Great Faunal Interchange? Describe island biogeography. Why is it relevant to this class? Contrast pre and postzygotic mating barriers What are Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities? Compare allopatric and sympatric speciation. How might hybrids have greater fitness than their parents? Explain the importance of Wolbachia. Describe the cause of a contemporary group of extinctions. Give an example of a biological trait that may increase extinction risk. Why might it? How could phylogenetic diversity be useful for conservation? Describe a simple model for species diversification. Compare and contrast speciation rate and diversification rate. How may trait transitions and diversification rates together affect evolution of a group? Which requirement for natural selection is most important? Why? What, in the context of this class, is an advantage of sexual reproduction? Describe Muller’s ratchet Describe one mechanism of sexual selection. What is Cope’s rule? Why might it be true? Contrast what a passive and an active trend mean. How would you detect evidence of a trend? Contrast mutualism with parasitism. How can one change into the other? Give an example of a commensalism. Define what is an evolutionarily stable strategy? Why is “the good of the species” a problematic concept? Why might a prey item call out to a predator? What is inclusive fitness? What is Hamilton’s rule? Give a behavior the idea of inclusive fitness could explain. Why can it be empirically difficult to know if two populations are the same or different species? Relate Darwin’s work on reefs to his work on evolution. What are some potential reasons that gliding evolves much more often than flight? What evidence links humans to some megafaunal extinctions? Pasteur showed life does not spontaneously appear. Biologists believe life originally spontaneously appeared. Reconcile these views. Use insects as an example of a macroevolutionary process. What may explain evolution of intelligence? What factors affect evolution of virulence in diseases? How would you test the idea of punctuated equilibrium?

Background reading: Maddison 1997 PDFQuiz\n Species, speciation, taxonomy PDF\n Diversification PDF\n  Study Guide I had three main goals in this section: making sure you know what sort of questions you can address using phylogenies, having some idea of what methods are available (or close to being available, with a little work) to answer these questions, and having the basic understanding to read and know how to build a tree. Things you won’t have to know: the difference between gamma and kappa, the equation for multivariate normal, authors behind methods, or similar specifics that you’ll forget again in a month. What I do want you to know:\n How are trees made?\n Why are trees made?\n Compare and contrast a phylogram and a chronogram.\n Given a tree, answer questions about its topology or other features (i.e., what’s the closest relative to X on the tree?).\n Compare and contrast bootstrapping and Bayesian approaches for understanding uncertainty.\n What is a continuous time Markov chain with a finite state space?\n Why do we care about the above?\n How are models for DNA related to models for a binary morphological trait?\n Connect the central limit theorem to the multivariate normal. Why does this make sense for an evolutionary model?\n What is independent contrasts? When would you use this?\n What are ways to deal with heterogeneity of processes on a tree? Why is this important?\n What is tree stretching? What questions does this let you ask?\n What are sister group comparisons used for?\n What is the difference between Bayesian and likelihood approaches?\n Compare and contrast hypothesis testing, model selection, and parameter estimation.\n What are some approaches to understanding diversification?\n Why are there methods for jointly looking at diversification and trait evolution?\n Given a certain biological question, I may ask you what sort of approach you would take to it. The various empirical examples should help with this.\n  Note that this is the content I want you to know, but not necessarily the questions. There would not be time for these to be essay questions, so I will ask for some of this information in short answer questions and just a few essays.\n ","date":1406865650,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406865650,"objectID":"23aef302cf4a1fc61be5d3522448c8eb","permalink":"/_posts/grad-core-phylogenetics-2014/","publishdate":"2014-08-01T04:00:50Z","relpermalink":"/_posts/grad-core-phylogenetics-2014/","section":"_posts","summary":"UTK EEB requires new graduate students to take an intensive team-taught course covering ecology and evolution.

You can get an installer from http://cran.r-project.org/ . 2) Read this web page: http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/Phylogenetics_and_Comparative_Methods_in_R 3) Read and do the exercises (aka “type ~8 lines”) from this web page: http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/I._Getting_Started_with_R . Do the task view route (it’s easier). 4) Write me an email with the info you get from the See Also section when you run ?read.tree after doing the tutorial (should be one line).\n Day 2 Topics:\nTreespace/NP-nasty\nHistory\nDistance\nParsimony\nLong branch attraction Slides: pdf, keynote, mov (QuickTime movie) R assignment: Plot the number of trees vs the number of taxa. Here is the second assignment. Note that http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf is a very readable tutorial you may want to download (written by the same guy who wrote the phylogenetic package ape). The homework is due by start of class on Friday. 1. Fire up R. Input library(phangorn) to load the Phangorn package (who gets the geeky reference? Why the F-\u0026gt;Ph transition? Get used to this sort of thing). If this gives you an error, try installing it – install.packages(“phangorn”) 2. Create a plain text file (no formatting: .txt rather than .rdf) called treespace.R. We’re going to be typing our commands in this. 3. Go to http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html 4. Read and understand sections 1.5, 1.7, 1.10, 2.1, 2.3, 2.8, 3.2, 12.1, 12.1.4, and 13 [the other bits are handy, too, but I want to minimize your workload]. 5. Read the documentation for allTrees (just type ?allTrees ), plot (same way), and length . 6. Treespace is big, as we’ll learn on Friday. Let’s see how big. In your treespace.R file, include the following commands (don’t copy in “7. Don’t paste this…” or the lines after that into the file). Remember that anything after a # sign is ignored by R (it’s a comment). I’m also attaching this as a file in case the formatting is affected by emailing it.\nlibrary(phangorn) #to load the phangorn package x\u0026lt;-c() #creates an empty x vector y\u0026lt;-c() #creates an empty y vector for (number_of_taxa in 3:8) { #this starts a loop: the first time through, variable number_of_taxa=3, the next time, it equals 4, then 5, etc. up to and including 8. print(\u0026quot;now doing this number of taxa:\u0026quot;) print(number_of_taxa) x[number_of_taxa-2]\u0026lt;-number_of_taxa #here we are sticking the number of taxa into vector x. x[1] is the first slot in that vector, x[2] is the second slot in that vector… (it expands if it is not that size already -- not all languages do that). Think about why we do number_of_taxa - 2 rather than number_of_taxa. #WAY TO STORE THE LENGTH OF THE OUTPUT FROM allTrees, WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE TREES, FOR PLOTTING ON THE Y-AXIS } #PLOT THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE TREES VERSUS THE NUMBER OF TAXA (DO A LOG SCALE FOR NUMBER OF TREES) Don’t paste this or following lines into your file Replace the #WAY… and #PLOT… comments with functioning R code. I’ve given you hints (why did I have you look at what the allTrees command does? what’s that y\u0026lt;-c() in the code for?). Try running your code – copy and paste into R, or on a Mac you can select all and then command+return to have it run (if you’re editing the text within an R window), or you can use source(“treespace.R”) if you have set the working directory to the folder containing the file (?setwd or use an option in the menu). Fix the errors, repeat 9 (see the joys of loops? – “while (working==FALSE) { debug some more }”). Send me your final figure (screenshot, pdf, etc.) and your treespace.R file. Is the number of trees growing exponentially with the number of taxa? Are you sure? BONUS (optional): How can you tell? If you’re still up for it (this part is optional, too), modify your code to look at all trees from 3 to 9 taxa rather than from 3 to 8. You’ll need to be very patient. Why? Bang your head against this for awhile, then talk to your cohort-mates for help, and/or email me. A lot of programming issues, especially early on, are frustrating in the way these problems are (i.e., what function lets me count the number of trees? how do I stick things in a vector?), and it’s salutary to try to work through them. There are generally several ways to solve each problem – go for the one that works first. Later you can tweak with speed, memory usage, code beauty (yes, really), etc. There are a few mailing lists for help with R, and help with R for phylogenetics, but [most of you] are too new to R to start posting there.   Day 3 Topics:\nModels\nModel selection\nBayes/Likelihood\nR code for animation to make image\nSlides: pdf, keynote, mov (QuickTime movie)\nR assignment: Do your own tree search\nThe next assignment should be pretty fun. You are going to write a heuristic search algorithm for getting the maximum parsimony tree in R after downloading a set of GenBank sequences, also within R. I’ve sketched out a lot of the code – the main tricky bit should be figuring out how to store the best tree as you go and learning how to use an if() function. Comments in ALL CAPS are the sections you should focus on for changing. You’re encouraged to play with this assignment: maybe you want to plot the scores as you search, maybe you want to try different search strategies, etc. Feel free to email me for help or talk to your cohort-mates (remember you can use the blackboard forum, too). R code below and attached.\nAnd just think: on Monday, many of you had never coded before. Now, you’re able to create a phylogenetic search program and pull things from an online database!\nBrian\nlibrary(phangorn) accessionNumbers \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;U15717\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;U15718\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;U15719\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;U15720\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;U15721\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;U15722\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;U15723\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;U15724\u0026quot;) #These come from a paper by Paradis (1997) on Tanagers #USE THE read.GenBank command TO DOWNLOAD THESE SEQUENCES FROM GENBANK AND PUT THEM IN AN OBJECT CALLED sequences. #Note that it\u0026#39;s read.GenBank, not read.Genbank, read.genbank, readGenBank, etc. Programming is usually very case-sensitive distanceMatrix\u0026lt;-dist.dna(sequences) #get a distance matrix print(distanceMatrix) convertedSeqs\u0026lt;-phyDat(sequences) #convert to a format useful for phangorn treeBad\u0026lt;-upgma(distanceMatrix) #the UPGMA starting tree actually is not that bad (and a NJ tree is the same as the maximum parsimony tree).
